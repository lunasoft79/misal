He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is his Father.<br />Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will happen to him.<br />For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes.<br />With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience.<br />Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for according to his own words, God will take care of him.\"<br />These were their thoughts, but they erred; for their wickedness blinded them,<br />And they knew not the hidden counsels of God; neither did they count on a recompense of holiness nor discern the innocent souls' reward.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>34(33),17-18.19-20.21.23.</em><p>The LORD confronts the evildoers, <br />to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.<br />When the just cry out, the LORD hears them, <br />and from all their distress he rescues them.<br />The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; <br />and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.<br />Many are the troubles of the just man, <br />but out of them all the LORD delivers him.<br />He watches over all his bones; <br />not one of them shall be broken.<br />The LORD redeems the lives of his servants; <br />no one incurs guilt who takes refuge in him.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>7,1-2.10.25-30.</em><p>Jesus moved about within Galilee; but he did not wish to travel in Judea, because the Jews were trying to kill him.<br />But the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near.<br />But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, he himself also went up, not openly but (as it were) in secret.<br />So some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, \"Is he not the one they are trying to kill?<br />And look, he is speaking openly and they say nothing to him. Could the authorities have realized that he is the Messiah?<br />But we know where he is from. When the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.\"<br />So Jesus cried out in the temple area as he was teaching and said, \"You know me and also know where I am from. Yet I did not come on my own, but the one who sent me, whom you do not know, is true.<br />I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.\"<br />So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hugh(Bishop (1053-1132))</h3><p>SAINT HUGH Bishop (1053-1132) St. Hugh was born in 1053 at Chateau-neuf, in the territory of Valence in Dauphin√©. He received the gift of faith from the example and care of his loving and faithful parents. He excelled at studies by relying on the will of God, acting regularly and consistently, and cultivating the virtue of order. Hearing and responding to the call, St. Hugh chose to serve God in an ecclesiastical state. He gave himself with the full freedom of love, and accepted a canonry in the cathedral of Valence. St. Hugh's father, Odilo, served in the army. He labored to make his soldiers faithful servants of their Creator, and restrained vice through regulations and punishments. At the advice of his son, he afterwards became a Carthusian monk, and died at the age of a hundred, having received Extreme Unction and Viaticum from the hands of his son. St. Hugh likewise assisted his mother during her last moments; she who served God for many years by prayer, fasting, and generous alms-giving. St. Hugh's selfless love and reliance on the will of God disposed him to receive great graces during his canonry at the cathedral of Valence. Through \"the narrow gate\" and using the Means, with devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Hugh was made Bishop of Grenoble. He set himself at once to reprove vice and reform abuses. In short time, he saw his diocese changed into a city modeled on God's love through Jesus. After two years, he privately resigned his bishopric, presuming on the tacit consent of the Holy See, and, putting on the habit of St. Bennet, he entered upon a novitiate in the austere abbey of Casa-Dei in Auvergne. There, he lived one year, a perfect model of all virtues to that house of Saints, till Pope Gregory VII commanded him, in virtue of holy obedience, to resume his pastoral charge. St. Hugh earnestly solicited Pope Innocent II for leave to resign his bishopric that he might die in solitude, but was never able to obtain his request. God was pleased to purify him by a lingering illness before he passed away. Shortly before his passing, St. Hugh lost memory for everything but his prayers. St. Hugh closed his penitential course on April 1, 1132, two months before his eightieth birthday. He had spent the last fifty-two years serving as bishop. Miracles attested the sanctity of his happy death, and he was canonized by Innocent II in 1134.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mary of Egypt(Hermit (c.344-421))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARY OF EGYPTHermit(c. 344-421) At the tender age of twelve, St. Mary left her father's house and sinned without restraint, and for seventeen years she lived in shame at Alexandria. When she accompanied a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, she entangled many in grievous sin. She was in Jerusalem during the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, and went with the crowd to a church which contained the precious wood. The rest entered and adored, but Mary was invisibly held back. In that instant, her misery and uncleanliness dawned upon her. Turning to the Immaculate Mother, whose picture faced her in the porch, she vowed to do penance if she might enter and stand like Magdalen beside the Cross. St. Mary then entered the church and knelt by the Cross. On leaving, she knelt before Our Lady, and a voice came to her which said, \"Pass over Jordan, and thou shalt find rest.\" St. Mary went into the wilderness and passed over Jordan. In 420, forty-seven years later, the Abbot Zosimus met her. She told him that for seventeen years, the old songs and scenes haunted her; ever after, she had perfect peace. At her request, he brought her the sacred body of Christ on Holy Thursday.She bade him return again after a year. This time, he found passed away, resting upon the sand. An inscription said, \"Bury here the body of Mary the sinner.\" The Bollandists place her death on April 1, 421. The Greek Church celebrates her feast on 1 April, while the Roman Martyrology assigns it to 2 April, and the Roman Calendar to 3 April. The Greek date is more likely to be correct; the others may be due to the fact that on those days portions of her relics reached the West.</p>"

Look and see that no prophet arises from Galilee.\"<br />Then each went to his own house,</p><hr /><h3>St. Francis of Paula(Hermit (1416-1508))</h3><p>SAINT FRANCIS OF PAULA Hermit(1416-1508) When he was fifteen, St. Francis left his home at Paula in Calabria, Italy to live as a hermit in a cave by the sea. In time, disciples gathered around him. In 1436, he founded the \"Minims,\" so called to show that they were the least of monastic Orders. The monks observed a perpetual Lent, and never touched meat, fish, eggs, or milk. Francis himself made a rock his bed. His best garment was a hair-shirt, and he subsisted on boiled herbs. As his body withered, his faith grew powerful, and he \"did all things in Him who strengthened me.\" He cured the sick, raised the dead, averted plagues, expelled evil spirits, and brought sinners to penance. A famous preacher, instigated by a few misguided monks, set to work to preach against St. Francis and his miracles. The Saint took no notice of it, and the preacher, finding that he made no way with his hearers, determined to see the poor hermit in person. The Saint received him kindly, gave him a seat by the fire, and listened to a long exposition of his own frauds. He then quietly took some glowing embers from the fire, and closing his hands upon them unhurt, said, \"Come, Father Anthony, warm yourself, for you are shivering for want of a little charity.\" Fr. Anthony, falling at the Saint's feet, asked for pardon, and then, having received his embrace, quitted him, became the latter's panegyrist, and attained himself to greater perfection. When the avaricious King Ferdinand of Naples offered St. Francis money for his convent, St. Francis told him to give it back to his oppressed subjects; and softened the king's heart by causing blood to flow from the coins.Louis XI of France, trembling at the approach of death, sent for St. Francis to ward off the foe whose advance neither his fortresses nor his guards could check. St. Francis went, by the Pope's command, and prepared Louis XI for a holy death. The successors of Louis showered favors on the Saint; his Order spread throughout Europe, and his name was reverenced through the Christian world.He passed away at the age of ninety-one, on Good Friday, 1507, with the crucifix in his hand and Jesus' name on his lips.</p>"

Now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? In the desert I make a way, in the wasteland, rivers.<br />Wild beasts honor me, jackals and ostriches, For I put water in the desert and rivers in the wasteland for my chosen people to drink,<br />The people whom I formed for myself, that they might announce my praise.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>126(125),1-2ab.2cd-3.4-5.6.</em><p>When the LORD brought back the captives of Zion, <br />we were like men dreaming.<br />Then our mouth was filled with laughter,<br />and our tongue with rejoicing.<br />Then they said among the nations,<br />\"the LORD has done great things for them.\"<br />The LORD has done great things for us; <br />we are glad indeed.<br />Restore our fortunes, O LORD, <br />like the torrents in the southern desert.<br />Those that sow in tears <br />shall reap rejoicing.<br />Although they go forth weeping, <br />carrying the seed to be sown, <br />they shall come back rejoicing, <br />carrying their sheaves.</p><h3>Letter to the Philippians</h3><em>3,8-14.</em><p>Brothers and sisters: I consider everything as a loss because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.

Just one thing: forgetting what lies behind but straining forward to what lies ahead,<br />I continue my pursuit toward the goal, the prize of God's upward calling, in Christ Jesus.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>8,1-11.</em><p>Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<br />But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area, and all the people started coming to him, and he sat down and taught them.<br />Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle.<br />They said to him, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.<br />Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?\"<br />They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.<br />But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, \"Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\"<br />Again he bent down and wrote on the ground.<br />And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him.<br />Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"<br />She replied, \"No one, sir.\" Then Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you. Go, (and) from now on do not sin any more.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Richard(Bishop (1197-1253))</h3><p>SAINT RICHARD OF CHICHESTER Bishop (1197-1253) St. Richard was born in 1197 in the little town of Wyche, eight miles from Worcester, England. When he and his elder brother were orphaned, Richard gave up his studies to farm his brother's impoverished estate. His brother, in gratitude, proposed to grant him the lands, but Richard refused both estate and the offer of a brilliant marriage to study for the priesthood at Oxford. In 1235, Fr. Richard he was appointed chancellor of Oxford University. Afterward, he was appointed chancellor of the diocese of St. Edmund of Canterbury. He stood by St. Edmund during the Saint's long contest with the king, and even accompanied St. Edmund into exile. After St. Edmund's death, Fr. Richard returned to England to work as a simple curate. He was soon elected Bishop of Chichester in preference to the nominee of Henry III. The king, in retaliation, refused to recognize the election, and seized the revenues of the see. Thus Bp. Richard found himself fighting the same battle in which St. Edmund had died. Bp. Richard went to Lyons, was there consecrated by Innocent IV in 1245, and returned to England. In spite of his poverty and the king's hostility, Bp. Richard fully exercised his episcopal rights.After two years, the revenues of the see were restored. Bp. Richard gave all he had, and worked miracles to feed the poor and heal the sick; but when the freedom or purity of the Church were threatened, he was its mightiest protector.When a priest of noble lineage polluted his office by sin, Bp. Richard revoked his benefice, and refused the king's petition for reinstatement. When a knight violently put a priest in prison, Bp. Richard compelled the knight to walk around the priest's church with a log of wood on his neck to which he had chained the priest. When the burgesses of Lewes tore a criminal from church and hanged him, Bp. Richard made them dig up the body from its unconsecrated grave and bear it back to the sanctuary they had violated. Bp. Richard passed away in 1253 while preaching, at the Pope's command, a crusade against the Saracens. He reigns with Christ and intercedes forever.</p>"

She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.<br />Nobody else was there except the two elders, who had hidden themselves and were watching her.<br />\"Bring me oil and soap,\" she said to the maids, \"and shut the garden doors while I bathe.\"<br />As soon as the maids had left, the two old men got up and hurried to her.<br />\"Look,\" they said, \"the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us; give in to our desire, and lie with us.<br />If you refuse, we will testify against you that you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.\"<br />\"I am completely trapped,\" Susanna groaned. \"If I yield, it will be my death; if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.<br />Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guilt than to sin before the Lord.\"<br />Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,<br />as one of them ran to open the garden doors.<br />When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden, they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.<br />At the accusations by the old men, the servants felt very much ashamed, for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.<br />When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day, the two wicked elders also came, fully determined to put Susanna to death. Before all the people they ordered:<br />\"Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, the wife of Joakim.\" When she was sent for,<br />she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.<br />All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.<br />In the midst of the people the two elders rose up and laid their hands on her head.<br />Through her tears she looked up to heaven, for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.<br />The elders made this accusation: \"As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman entered with two girls and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.<br />A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.<br />When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime, we ran toward them.<br />We saw them lying together, but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we; he opened the doors and ran off.<br />Then we seized this one and asked who the young man was,<br />but she refused to tell us. We testify to this.\" The assembly believed them, since they were elders and judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.<br />But Susanna cried aloud: \"O eternal God, you know what is hidden and are aware of all things before they come to be:<br />you know that they have testified falsely against me. Here I am about to die, though I have done none of the things with which these wicked men have charged me.\"<br />The Lord heard her prayer.<br />As she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,<br />and he cried aloud: \"I will have no part in the death of this woman.\"<br />All the people turned and asked him, \"What is this you are saying?\"<br />He stood in their midst and continued, \"Are you such fools, O Israelites! To condemn a woman of Israel without examination and without clear evidence?<br />Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.\"<br />Then all the people returned in haste. To Daniel the elders said, \"Come, sit with us and inform us, since God has given you the prestige of old age.\"<br />But he replied, \"Separate these two far from one another that I may examine them.\"<br />After they were separated one from the other, he called one of them and said: \"How you have grown evil with age! Now have your past sins come to term:<br />passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent, and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says, \"The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'<br />Now, then, if you were a witness, tell me under what tree you saw them together.\"<br />\"Under a mastic tree,\" he answered. \"Your fine lie has cost you your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him and split you in two.\"<br />Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought. \"Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,\" Daniel said to him, \"beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience.<br />This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel, and in their fear they yielded to you; but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.<br />Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.\"<br />\"Under an oak,\" he said. \"Your fine lie has cost you also your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two so as to make an end of you both.\"<br />The whole assembly cried aloud, blessing God who saves those that hope in him.<br />They rose up against the two elders, for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury. According to the law of Moses, they inflicted on them the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:<br />they put them to death. Thus was innocent blood spared that day.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>23(22),1-3a.3b-4.5.6.</em><p>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br />In verdant pastures he gives me repose; <br />beside restful waters he leads me;<br />he refreshes my soul. <br />He guides me in right paths<br />for His names's sake.<br />Even though I walk in the dark valley <br />I fear no evil; for you are at my side <br />with your rod and your staff <br />that give me courage.<br />You spread the table before me <br />in the sight of my foes; <br />You anoint my head with oil; <br />my cup overflows.<br />Only goodness and kindness follow me <br />all the days of my life; <br />and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD <br />for years to come.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>8,12-20.</em><p>Jesus spoke to them again, saying, ¬´I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.¬ª<br />So the Pharisees said to him, \"You testify on your own behalf, so your testimony cannot be verified.\"<br />Jesus answered and said to them, \"Even if I do testify on my own behalf, my testimony can be verified, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.<br />You judge by appearances, but I do not judge anyone.<br />And even if I should judge, my judgment is valid, because I am not alone, but it is I and the Father who sent me.<br />Even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men can be verified.<br />I testify on my behalf and so does the Father who sent me.\"<br />So they said to him, \"Where is your father?\" Jesus answered, \"You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\"<br />He spoke these words while teaching in the treasury in the temple area. But no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</p><hr /><h3>St. Isidore of Seville(Archbishop (+ 636))</h3><p>SAINT ISIDORE Archbishop(c. 560-636) Isidore was born of a ducal family at Carthagena in Spain. His brothers, Leander, Archbishop of Seville, and Fulgentius, Bishop of Ecija, and his sister, Florentina, are Saints. As a boy, he despaired at failure in studies and ran away from school. Resting in his flight at a roadside spring, he observed a stone that was hollowed out by dripping water. This decided him to return, and by hard application, he succeeded where he had failed. He went back to his master, and with the help of God became, even as a youth, one of the most learned men of the time. Isidore assisted in converting Prince Recared, the leader of the Arian party; and with the latter's aid, though at the constant peril of his own life, expelled that heresy from Spain.Then, following a call from God, Isidore turned a deaf ear to the entreaties of his friends and embraced a hermit's life. Prince Recared and many of the nobles and clergy of Seville went to persuade him to come forth, and represented the needs of the times, and the good he could do and had already done among the people. He refused, and, as far as we can judge, that refusal gave him the necessary opportunity of acquiring the virtue and the power which afterwards made him an illustrious Bishop and Doctor of the Church. On the death of his brother, Leander, Isidore was called to fill the vacant see. As a teacher, ruler, founder, and reformer, he labored not only in his own diocese, but throughout Spain, and even in foreign countries.He passed away in Seville on April 4, 636, and within sixteen years was declared a Doctor of the Church.</p>"

We are disgusted with this wretched food!\"<br />In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents, which bit the people so that many of them died.<br />Then the people came to Moses and said, \"We have sinned in complaining against the LORD and you. Pray the LORD to take the serpents from us.\" So Moses prayed for the people,<br />and the LORD said to Moses, \"Make a saraph and mount it on a pole, and if anyone who has been bitten looks at it, he will recover.\"<br />Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole, and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>102(101),2-3.16-18.19-21.</em><p>LORD, hear my prayer; <br />let my cry come to you.<br />Do not hide your face from me <br />now that I am in distress. <br />Turn your ear to me; <br />when I call, answer me quickly.<br />The nations shall revere your name, O LORD, <br />and all the kings of the earth your glory,<br />when the LORD has rebuilt Zion <br />and appeared in his glory;<br />when he has regarded the prayer of the destitute, <br />and not despised their prayer.<br />Let this be written for the generation to come, <br />and let his future creatures praise the LORD:<br />\"The LORD looked down from his holy height, <br />from heaven he beheld the earth,<br />to hear the groaning of the prisoners, <br />to release those doomed to die.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>8,21-30.</em><p>Jesus said to the Pharisees: \"I am going away and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin.

But the one who sent me is true, and what I heard from him I tell the world.\"<br />They did not realize that he was speaking to them of the Father.<br />So Jesus said (to them), \"When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I AM, and that I do nothing on my own, but I say only what the Father taught me.<br />The one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.\"<br />Because he spoke this way, many came to believe in him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Vincent Ferrer(Priest (1350-1419))</h3><p>SAINT VINCENT FERRER Dominican priest (1350-1419) This wonderful apostle, \"Angel of the Judgment,\" was born at Valencia in Spain in 1350. At the age of eighteen, he professed vows in the Order of St. Dominic. After a brilliant course of study, he earned the distinction, \"master of sacred theology.\" For three years, he read only the Scriptures and knew the whole Bible by heart. St. Vincent converted the Jews of Valencia, and their synagogue became a church. Grief at the schism then afflicting the Church reduced him to the point of death; but Our Lord in glory bade him go forth to convert sinners. His ensuingapostolate lasted twenty-one years. He preached throughout Europe, in the towns and villages of Spain, Switzerland, France, Italy, England, Ireland, and Scotland. Everywhere, thousands of sinners manifested contrition and returned to Christ; pagans and heretics converted to the Faith; and Jews and Muslims received faith in the Messiah, the Lamb of God. Proven miracles accompanied St. Vincent's selfless life. Twice each day, his bellcalled the sick, the blind, and the lame to be cured. Speaking only his native Spanish, he was understood in all tongues. Processions of thousands followed him; and convents, orphanages, and hospitals arose in his path. Amidst all, St. Vincent's humility remained profound and his prayer constant. He always prepared for preaching by prayer. Once, however, when a person of high rank was to be present at his sermon, St. Vincent neglected prayer for study. The nobleman was not particularly struck by the discourse which had been carefully written; but coming again to hear the Saint, unknown to the latter, the second sermon made a deep impression on his soul. When St. Vincent heard of the difference, he remarked that: in the first sermon, it was Vincent who had preached, but in the second, Jesus Christ. St. Vincent passed away at Vannes in Brittany after an illness. He received the beatific vision - of seeing God face to face; proven by his life, heroic virtues, and the miracles proceeding from his intercesion.</p>"

He was born circa 840 to a distinguished family. He studied with Tuotilo at Saint Gall's monastic school, taught by Iso, and Moengall. He became a monk there and is mentioned as a librarian in 890 and as a master of guests in 892-4. He was chiefly active in teaching, and displayed refinement of taste as poet and author. Ekkehard IV, the biographer of the monks of Saint Gall, lauds him as \"delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine, a vessel of the Holy Spirit without equal in his time.\" Bl.

Augusto Czartoryski(Priest (1858-1893))</h3><p>Blessed Augusto Czartoryski Priest of the Salesians of Don Bosco (1858-1893) Bl. Augusto Czartoryski was born on 2 August 1858 in Paris, France, the firstborn son of Prince Ladislaus of Poland and Princess Maria Amparo, daughter of the Duke and Queen of Spain. The noble Czartoryski Family had been living in exile in France for almost 30 years, in the Lambert Palace. Here, with the hope of restoring unity in Poland, they continued to direct activities between their fellow Polish countrymen and the European chancellery.Plans for a future Prince It was already planned that Augusto would be a future \"reference point\" for this restoration and would carry on the \"Czartoryski\" name. God's designs, however, were to unfold differently. When Augusto was 6, his mother died of tuberculosis; the disease was also transmitted to him, and for the rest of his life he would be plagued by ill health. Although he had to make \"forced pilgrimages\" with his father to Italy, Switzerland, Egypt and Spain in search of a cure, he never regained his health. As he grew up, Augusto felt that he was not meant for the life of nobility, and one day, when he was 20 years old, he wrote to his father: \"I confess to you that I am tired [of all the parties]; they are superficial entertainments that cause me anguish and I feel myself forced to make acquaintances with others at these banquets.\" Augusto already received spiritual direction from his tutor, Joseph Kalinsowski, who would later become a Carmelite, and who, before leaving for Carmel in 1877, wrote to Prince Ladislaus to suggest that it would be wise, considering the boy's love for God, to entrust him to the direction of a priest.Encounter with Don Bosco Prince Ladislaus accepted the counsel given by Augusto's tutor; and Fr. Stanislaus Kubowicz began to guide him. Augusto was already feeling more and more called to religious life and was hoping for a clearer indication of what God wanted from him: this \"decisive event\" took place when he was 25 and met Don Bosco, founder of the Salesians. When Don Bosco came to Paris and celebrated Mass in the family chapel of the Lambert Palace, Augusto saw in this holy founder and teacher the \"father of his soul\" and guide for his future. While Augusto remained quiet and withdrawn in the face of matrimony plans made for him by his father, he had no intention of continuing the \"noble line.\" Indeed, after his first encounter with the Salesian saint, he was more resolute than ever to answer God's call by becoming a Salesian. When his father gave him permission, Augusto would travel to Turin to meet with Don Bosco and participate in spiritual retreats. He became comfortable with the \"poverty\" of the Salesian Oratory and was not disturbed by his frequent ill health or his father's opposition; he instead saw God's hand in all these circumstances. He would say: \"If God wants this, all will go well since he can take away every obstacle. If he does not want this, then neither do I.\"A \"Prince\" for God's Kingdom Don Bosco was somewhat reluctant to accept Augusto into the Salesian community. It took Pope Leo XIII to remove his doubts when he gave Augusto this message: \"Tell Don Bosco that it is the Pope's will that he receives you among the Salesians.\" Don Bosco replied: \"Well then, my dear son, I accept you. From this moment, you are a part of the Salesian Family and I desire that you belong here until you die.\" In 1887, Augusto began his novitiate under the guidance of Don Giulio Barberis. The young man had to overcome many \"habits\" and adjust to community life, schedule, frugal meals and other sacrifices. All this he did with great serenity and abandonment to God. When his father came to try to convince him to return home and accept his nobility as \"Prince,\" Augusto refused. On 24 November 1887, the day of his vesting in the hands of Don Bosco, the holy founder whispered into Augusto's ear: \"Courage, my prince! Today we have conquered, and I can also say with great joy that one day when you become a priest you will do much for your Country.\"One year as Christ's priest Don Bosco passed away two months later. Augusto's health was also worsening and his father continued to try to dissuade him from becoming a priest, using his ill health as an \"excuse.\" When Prince Ladislaus asked the \"help\" of Cardinal Parocchi to dismiss Augusto from the Salesians, Augusto wrote: \"In full liberty I made my vows and I did this with great joy of heart. From that day I continue to live in the Congregation with an immense peace of spirit, and I thank the Lord for allowing me to know the Salesian Family and for having called me to become a Salesian.\" On 2 April 1892, Augusto was ordained a priest by the Bishop of Ventimiglia. Although Prince Ladislaus was not present at the Ordination, a month later, joined by the entire family in Mentone, he reconciled himself with his son's decision and renounced his own dreams of prestige and nobility for Augusto. Fr. Augusto died on 8 April 1893 in Alassio, where he lived his year as a priest, occupying a room which looked out onto the courtyard where the children of the Oratory played. He was 35 years old. He was beatified on April 25, 2004 by St. Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Julia Billiart()</h3><hr />"

Lindalva Justo de Oliveira((1953-1993))</h3><p>Blessed Lindalva Justo de Oliveira Martyr, Religious Sister of the Society of the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul (1953-1993) Lindalva Justo de Oliveira was born on 20 October 1953 at Sitio Malhada da Areia, in a very poor area of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Lindalva's father, Jo√°o Justo da F√©, a farmer, was a widower. His second marriage was to Maria L√∫cia de Oliveira. Little Lindalva was the sixth of 13 children born to the couple. She was baptized on 7 January 1954. Her family was not well-off, but were rich in the faith. Jo√°o moved his family to A√ßu so his children could attend school, and after many sacrifices, he was able to buy a house where the family still resides today. Besides following her mother's good example, Lindalva demonstrated a natural inclination toward the poorer children and spent much time with them. At age 12, Lindalva received First Holy Communion, and during her school years she was always happy to help the less fortunate. Later, while living with her brother, Djalma, and his family in Natal, she received an administrative assistant's diploma in 1979. From 1978 to 1988, she held various jobs in retail sales and as a cashier at a petrol station, sending some of her salary to help her mother. Lindalva found time to visit the local home for the elderly every day after work. In 1982, as she lovingly assisted her father in the last months of his terminal illness, she reflected seriously on her life and decided to serve the poor. She then enrolled in a nursing course, but also enjoyed those things typical of young people: building friendships, guitar lessons and cultural studies. In 1986, she participated in the vocational initiatives of the Daughters of Charity. After she received the Sacrament of Confirmation in 1987, Lindalva applied for admission to the Daughters. On the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, 11 February 1988, she entered the postulancy and edified her companions with her joy and genuine concern for the poor. Her character was marked by a sweet disposition but also by truthfulness. In a letter to her alcoholic brother, Antonio, she wrote: \"Think about it and reward yourself. I pray for you very much and I will continue to pray; and if necessary, I will do penance so that you are able to fulfill yourself as a person. Follow Jesus, who fought until death for the life of sinners and gave his own life, not as God but as man, for the forgiveness of sins. We must seek refuge in him; only in him is life worth living.\" A year later, her brother quit drinking. On 29 January 1991, Sr. Lindalva was assigned 40 elderly male patients in the municipal nursing home in Salvador da Bahia. She undertook the more humble tasks and sought out those who suffered the most and cared for their spiritual and material well-being by encouraging their reception of the sacraments. Sr. Lindalva would sing and pray with them, and she even took her driving test so she could take them out for rides. During January of 1993, a certain Augusto da Silva Peixoto, a 46-year-old man with an irascible character, managed to be admitted to the facility through the recommendation of another, even though he had no right to be there. Sr. Lindalva treated him with the same courtesy and respect as the other patients, yet he became enamoured of her. She prudently distanced herself from him and was cautious in his regard. Nonetheless, he explicitly declared his lustful intentions towards her. A simple solution would have been for Sr. Lindalva to leave, but her love for the elderly caused her to declare, \"I prefer to shed my blood than to leave this place.\" By 30 March, Augusto's advances became so insistent and frightening that she sought the help of a health-care official to restrain this unruly patient. Although he promised to improve his attitude and behaviour, he harboured hatred and vengeance that developed into a murderous plan. On 9 April 1993, Good Friday, Sr. Lindalva took part in the parish Way of the Cross at 4:30 in the morning. By 7 a.m., she was back at work to prepare and serve breakfast as she did every day. As she served coffee from behind a table, Augusto approached and thrust a fishmonger's knife above her collar-bone. Sinking to the ground, she cried \"God protect me\" several times. Patients ran for cover. Enveloped in an insane rapture while holding up her body, Augusto stabbed her 44 times shouting, \"I should have done this sooner!\"He then suddenly became calm, sat down on a bench, wiped the knife on his trousers, threw it on the table and exclaimed: \"She did not want me;\" and turning to the doctor, said, \"You can call the police, I will not run away; I did what had to be done.\" The next day, Holy Saturday, Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves, O.P., Primate of Brazil, celebrated the 39-year-old Sister's funeral and commented: \"A few years were enough for Sr. Lindalva to crown her Religious life with martyrdom\".</p><hr /><h3>St. Waldetrudis (+ c. 688)()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Waldetrudis(+ c. 688) Also known as Waltrude or Waudru, Waltrudis was the daughter of Saints Walbert and Bertilia and sister of St. Aldegunus of Maubeuge. Marrying St. Vincent Madelgarius, she became the mother of Saints Landericus, Madalberta, Adeltrudis, and Dentelin. When her husband chose to become a monk about 643 in the monastery of Hautrnont, France which he had founded, she established a convent at Chateaulieu around which grew up the town of Mons, Belgium.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gaucherius()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

I am among you as the one who serves.<br />It is you who have stood by me in my trials;<br />and I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred one on me,<br />that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br />Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift all of you like wheat,<br />but I have prayed that your own faith may not fail; and once you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.\"<br />He said to him, \"Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.\"<br />But he replied, \"I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day, you will deny three times that you know me.\"<br />He said to them, \"When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?\" \"No, nothing,\" they replied.<br />He said to them, \"But now one who has a money bag should take it, and likewise a sack, and one who does not have a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.<br />For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, namely, 'He was counted among the wicked'; and indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.\"<br />Then they said, \"Lord, look, there are two swords here.\" But he replied, \"It is enough!\"<br />Then going out he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him.<br />When he arrived at the place he said to them, \"Pray that you may not undergo the test.\"<br />After withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling, he prayed,<br />saying, \"Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me; still, not my will but yours be done.\"<br />(And to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.<br />He was in such agony and he prayed so fervently that his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground.)<br />When he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.<br />He said to them, \"Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not undergo the test.\"<br />While he was still speaking, a crowd approached and in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas. He went up to Jesus to kiss him.<br />Jesus said to him, \"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\"<br />His disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked, \"Lord, shall we strike with a sword?\"<br />And one of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear.<br />But Jesus said in reply, \"Stop, no more of this!\" Then he touched the servant's ear and healed him.<br />And Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards and elders who had come for him, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?<br />Day after day I was with you in the temple area, and you did not seize me; but this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.\"<br />After arresting him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest; Peter was following at a distance.<br />They lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter sat down with them.<br />When a maid saw him seated in the light, she looked intently at him and said, \"This man too was with him.\"<br />But he denied it saying, \"Woman, I do not know him.\"<br />A short while later someone else saw him and said, \"You too are one of them\"; but Peter answered, \"My friend, I am not.\"<br />About an hour later, still another insisted, \"Assuredly, this man too was with him, for he also is a Galilean.\"<br />But Peter said, \"My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.\" Just as he was saying this, the cock crowed,<br />and the Lord turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, \"Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.\"<br />He went out and began to weep bitterly.<br />The men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.<br />They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, \"Prophesy! Who is it that struck you?\"<br />And they reviled him in saying many other things against him.<br />When day came the council of elders of the people met, both chief priests and scribes, and they brought him before their Sanhedrin.<br />They said, \"If you are the Messiah, tell us,\" but he replied to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe,<br />and if I question, you will not respond.<br />But from this time on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.\"<br />They all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\" He replied to them, \"You say that I am.\"<br />Then they said, \"What further need have we for testimony? We have heard it from his own mouth.\"<br />Then the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.<br />They brought charges against him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our people; he opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar and maintains that he is the Messiah, a king.\"<br />Pilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He said to him in reply, \"You say so.\"<br />Pilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds, \"I find this man not guilty.\"<br />But they were adamant and said, \"He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee where he began even to here.\"<br />On hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;<br />and upon learning that he was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.<br />Herod was very glad to see Jesus; he had been wanting to see him for a long time, for he had heard about him and had been hoping to see him perform some sign.<br />He questioned him at length, but he gave him no answer.<br />The chief priests and scribes, meanwhile, stood by accusing him harshly.<br />(Even) Herod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him, and after clothing him in resplendent garb, he sent him back to Pilate.<br />Herod and Pilate became friends that very day, even though they had been enemies formerly.<br />Pilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people<br />and said to them, \"You brought this man to me and accused him of inciting the people to revolt. I have conducted my investigation in your presence and have not found this man guilty of the charges you have brought against him,<br />nor did Herod, for he sent him back to us. So no capital crime has been committed by him.<br />Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"<br />But all together they shouted out, \"Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us.\"<br />(Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion that had taken place in the city and for murder.)<br />Again Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,<br />but they continued their shouting, \"Crucify him! Crucify him!\"<br />Pilate addressed them a third time, \"What evil has this man done? I found him guilty of no capital crime. Therefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"<br />With loud shouts, however, they persisted in calling for his crucifixion, and their voices prevailed.<br />The verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.<br />So he released the man who had been imprisoned for rebellion and murder, for whom they asked, and he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.<br />As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they made him carry it behind Jesus.<br />A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him.<br />Jesus turned to them and said, \"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children,<br />for indeed, the days are coming when people will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.'<br />At that time people will say to the mountains, 'Fall upon us!' and to the hills, 'Cover us!'<br />for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?\"<br />Now two others, both criminals, were led away with him to be executed.<br />When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him and the criminals there, one on his right, the other on his left.<br />(Then Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\") They divided his garments by casting lots.<br />The people stood by and watched; the rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said, \"He saved others, let him save himself if he is the chosen one, the Messiah of God.\"<br />Even the soldiers jeered at him. As they approached to offer him wine<br />they called out, \"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.\"<br />Above him there was an inscription that read, \"This is the King of the Jews.\"<br />Now one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying, \"Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us.\"<br />The other, however, rebuking him, said in reply, \"Have you no fear of God, for you are subject to the same condemnation?<br />And indeed, we have been condemned justly, for the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes, but this man has done nothing criminal.\"<br />Then he said, \"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"<br />He replied to him, \"Amen, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.\"<br />It was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon<br />because of an eclipse of the sun. Then the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.<br />Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\"; and when he had said this he breathed his last.<br />The centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said, \"This man was innocent beyond doubt.\"<br />When all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts;<br />but all his acquaintances stood at a distance, including the women who had followed him from Galilee and saw these events.<br />Now there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who, though he was a member of the council,<br />had not consented to their plan of action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea and was awaiting the kingdom of God.<br />He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<br />After he had taken the body down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid him in a rock-hewn tomb in which no one had yet been buried.<br />It was the day of preparation, and the sabbath was about to begin.<br />The women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind, and when they had seen the tomb and the way in which his body was laid in it,<br />they returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils. Then they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.</p><hr /><h3>St. Magdalena of Canossa(Virgin and Foundress (1774-1835))</h3><p>Saint Magdalena of Canossa Virgin, foundress of the Canossian Family of Daughters and Sons of Charity(1774-1835) Magdalena of Canossa believed in the love of the Lord Jesus. Sent by the Holy Spirit among those most in need, she served them with a Mother's heart and an Apostle's zeal. Born in Verona on 1st March 1774, of a noble and wealthy family, she was the third of six children.By way of painful events such as her father's death, her mother's second marriage, illness, and misunderstandings, the Lord guided her towards unforeseen paths on which she tentatively set out.A CALL Drawn by the love of God, at the age of seventeen she planned to consecrate her life to God and twice tried her vocation at a Carmel.However, the Holy Spirit urged her to follow a new path: to allow herself to be loved by Jesus Crucified, to belong to Him alone, in order to dedicate herself exclusively to those in greatest need. She returned to her family and, being compelled by sad events and the tragic political circumstances at the end of the 18th century, she nurtured her true vocation in the depth of her heart and went on with life at Canossa Palace, shouldering the burden of running her family's large estate.A GIFT With complete dedication, Magdalene carried out her daily tasks and widened her circle of friends while at the same time remaining open to the mysterious action of the Holy Spirit who gradually moulded her heart and enabled her to share in the love of the Father for mankind revealed by Jesus' complete and supreme offering of Himself on the Cross, and by the example of Mary, the Sorrowful Virgin Mother. Moved by that love, Magdalene responded to the cry of the poor, hungry for food, instruction, understanding and the Word of God. She discovered them in the suburbs of Verona, where the echoes of the French Revolution, the occupation by various foreign powers and the Verona uprising had left evident signs of devastation and human suffering.A PROJECT Magdalene sought and found her first companions called to follow Christ, poor, chaste, obedient and who were to be sent out as witnesses of His unconditional Love towards all people. In 1808, Magdalene overcame her family's opposition and left Canossa Palace once and for all to begin in the poorest district of Verona what she knew in her heart to be the Will of God: to serve the neediest persons with the heart of Christ.A PROPHECY Charity is like a blazing fire! Magdalene opened her heart to the Holy Spirit who guided her to the poor in other cities: Venice, Milan, Bergamo, Trent... In only a few decades, the number of her houses increased, her religious family grew in the service of the Kingdom of God. The Love of the Crucified and Risen Lord burnt in Magdalene's heart who, together with her companions, became a witness of that same love in five specific areas:Charity schools, providing an all-round formation geared to pupils status in life; Catechesis, given to all classes of people, with special attention to those most ignorant of the Faith;Support given to women patients in hospital;Residential seminars, to train young teachers for rural areas and valuable helpers for parish priests in their pastoral activities;and Yearly Courses of Spiritual Exercises for Ladies of the nobility, with the aim of deepening their spiritual life and involving them in various charitable works.Later on, this last activity was offered to all those who had a desire for it. Contemporary to Magdalene and her apostolic work flourished other witnesses of Charity: Leopoldina Naudet, Antonio Rosmini, Antonio Provolo, Carlo Steeb, Gaspare Bertoni, Teodora Campostrini, T. Eustochio Verzeri, Elisabetta Renzi, Cavanis brothers, Pietro Leonardi, all of whom founded Religious Institutes. A FAMILY The Institute of the Daughters of Charity, between 1819 and 1820, received its ecclesiastical approval in the various dioceses where the communities were present. Pope Leo XII approved the Rule of the Institute with the papal brief \"Si Nobis\" on 23rd December 1828. Towards the end of her life, after unsuccessful attempts with A. Rosmini and A. Provolo, Magdalene was able to start the male branch of the Institute which she had planned to set up from the very beginning. On 23th May 1831 in Venice, she began the first Oratory of the Sons of Charity for the Christian formation of boys and men. She entrusted it to the Venetian priest Don Francesco Luzzo, helped by two laymen from Bergamo: Giuseppe Carsana and Benedetto Belloni. Magdalene's active and fruitful life ended when she was 61 years of age. She passed away in Verona surrounded by her Daughters on 10th April 1835. It was the Friday of Passion Week.A MISSION Above all make Jesus Christ known! This heartfelt concern of Magdalene's was the great inheritance that the Daughters and Sons of Charity are called to live, a life of complete availability to God and service towards others, willing to go to the most distant countries for the sake of this holy work. (MAGDALENE, Ep. II/I, p. 266). The Daughters of Charity traveled for the Far East in 1860. Today, there are about 4000 sisters throughout the world grouped into 24 provinces.The Sons of Charity number about 200. They work in various cities in Italy, Latin America and the Philippines. Canossian Religious, called to a missionary vocation, \"ad gentes,\" make themselves receptive to those basic Christian values, \"the seeds of the Word,\" present in every culture, while giving witness to and proclaiming they \"have seen, heard, and contemplated...\": the Love of the Father who, in Christ, reaches out to every person so that they may have life. Through this giving and receiving, the charism is enriched and bears fruit for God's Kingdom. The charism which the Holy Spirit brought to life in Magdalene did not exhaust itself in the vitality of the two Institutes. Consequently, various groups of lay people have found in Magdalene and in her ideals their special way of living the faith, of witnessing charity, in all walks of Christian life. She was beatified by Pius XII on December 7, 1941 and canonized by St. Pope John Paul II on October 2, 1988 at Rome.A SONG OF THANKSGIVING The Church draws our attention, especially that of her Sons and Daughters, to Magdalene, a Witness of the constant and freely given love of God.We give thanks to Him for the gift of this Mother and Sister of ours. Through her intercession, we ask that we may love God, as she did, above all other things, and make Him known to our fellow men by living our specific vocation.</p><hr /><h3>St. Fulbert()</h3><hr />"

Let her keep this for the day of my burial.<br />You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.\"<br />(The) large crowd of the Jews found out that he was there and came, not only because of Jesus, but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.<br />And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,<br />because many of the Jews were turning away and believing in Jesus because of him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Stanislas(Bishop and Martyr (1030-1079))</h3><p>SAINT STANISLAS Bishop and Martyr (1030-1079) St. Stanislas was born in answer to his parents' prayer who were advanced in age. Out of gratitude, they educated him for the Church. He was ordained, became a holy priest, and in time was elected Bishop of Cracow. The King of Poland, Boleslas II, spoilt by fleshly excesses, outraged the whole kingdom by carrying off the wife of one of his nobles. Against this public scandal, the chaste and gentle bishop alone raised his voice. Having commended the matter to God, he went down to the palace and openly rebuked the king for his crime against God and his subjects, and threatened to excommunicate him if he persisted in his sin. To slander the Saint's character, Boleslas suborned the nephews of one Paul, lately deceased, to swear that their uncle had never been paid for land bought by the bishop for the Church. The Saint stood fearlessly before the king's tribunal, though all his witnesses forsook him, and guaranteed to bring the dead man to witness for him within three days. On the third day, after many prayers and tears, Bp. Stanislas raised Paul to life, and led him in his grave-clothes before the king. Boleslas made a show for a while of a better life. Soon, however, he relapsed into the most scandalous excesses, and the bishop, finding all remonstrance useless, pronounced the sentence of excommunication. In defiance of the censure, on April 11, 1079, the king went down to a chapel where the bishop himself was saying Mass, and sent in three companies of soldiers to dispatch him at the altar. Each in turn came out, saying they had been scared by a light from heaven. Then the king rushed in and slew the Saint at the altar with his own hand.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gemma Galgani()</h3><hr /><p>St. Gemma Galgani(1878-1903) St. Gemma Galgani was born on March 12, 1878 in a small Italian town near Lucca. At a very young age, Gemma developed a love for prayer. She made her First Communion on June 17, 1887. As a pupil at the school run by the Sisters of St. Zita, Gemma was loved by her teachers and her fellow pupils. Although quiet and reserved, she always had a smile for everyone. Although a good student, she had to quit school due to chronic ill health before completing the course of study. Throughout her life, Gemma was to be favored with many mystical experiences and special graces. These were often misunderstood by others, causing ridicule. Gemma suffered these heartaches in reparation, remembering that Our Lord Himself had been misunderstood and ridiculed. Gemma had an immense love for the poor, and helped them in any way she could. After her father's death, the nineteen year old Gemma became the mother of her seven brothers and sisters. When some were old enough to share this responsibility, she lived briefly with a married aunt. At this time, two young men proposed marriage to her. Gemma however, wanted silence and retirement, and more that ever, she desired to pray and speak only to God. Gemma returned home and almost immediately became very ill with meningitis. Throughout this illness, her one regret was the trouble she caused her relatives who took care of her. Feeling herself tempted by the devil, Gemma prayed for help to the Venerable Passionist, Gabriel Possenti (Gabriel was later canonized). Through his intercession, Gemma was miraculously cured. Gemma wished to become a nun, but her poor health prevented her from being accepted. She offered this disappointment to God as a sacrifice. Gemma predicted that the Passionists would establish a monastery at Lucca; this came to pass two years after her death. Today, Gemma's mortal remains are still treasured at the Passionist monastery in Lucca. On June 8, 1899, Gemma had an interior warning that some unusual grace was to be granted to her. She had pain in her hands, feet and heart and blood was coming from the places where she had pain. These were the marks of the stigmata. Each Thursday evening, Gemma would fall into rapture and the marks would appear. The stigmata remained until Friday afternoon or Saturday morning when the bleeding would stop, the wounds would close, and only white marks would remain in place of the deep gashes. Gemma's stigmata would continue to appear until the last three years of her life, when her confessor forbade her to accept them. Through her prayers, this phenomenon ceased, but the whitish marks remained on her skin until her death. Through the help of her confessor, Gemma went to live with a family named Giannini, where she was allowed more freedom than at home for her spiritual life. She had many ecstacies and her words spoken during these raptures were recorded by her confessor and a relative of her adoptive family. At the end of her ecstacies, she returned to normal and went quietly and serenely about the family life. Gemma often saw her guardian angel, with whom she was on familiar terms. She often sent her guardian angel on errands, usually to deliver a letter or oral message to her confessor in Rome. During the apostolic investigations into her life, all witnesses testified that there was no artfulness in Gemma's manner. Most of her severe penances and sacrifices were hidden from most who knew her. In January of 1903, Gemma was diagnosed as having tuberculosis. She died quietly in the company of the parish priest, on April 11 at age twenty-five. He said, \"She died with a smile which remained upon her lips, so that I could not convince myself that she was really dead.\" She was beatified in 1933 and canonized on May 2, 1940, only thirty-seven years after her death.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gemma Galgani (1878 - 1903)()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow before you deny me three times.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Julius I(Pope (+ 352))</h3><p>SAINT JULIUS Pope (+ 352) St. Julius was a Roman. He was elected Pope on February 6, 337. He is honored as a protector of the Faith when detractors and heretics would subtract from the original deposit of Tradition and Scripture. When Arian bishops in the East sent deputies accusing St. Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria, the latter sent deputies to Rome. Upon an impartial hearing, the advocates of the heretics were confounded and silenced.The Arians then demanded a council, and St. Julius assembled one in Rome in 341. The Arians, instead of appearing, held a pretended council at Antioch in 341, in which they presumed to appoint one Gregory, an Arian, Bishop of Alexandria. Gregory detained the Pope's legates beyond the time mentioned for their appearance; and then wrote to St. Julius, alleging a pretended impossibility of their appearing, on account of the Persian war and other impediments. The Pope saw through these pretences, and in a council at Rome examined the cause of St. Athanasius, declared him innocent of the things laid to his charge by the Arians, and confirmed him in his see. St. Julius also acquitted Marcellus of Ancyra upon the latter's orthodox profession of faith.The Pope drew up and sent by Count Gabian to the Oriental Eusebian bishops, who had first demanded a council and then refused to appear in it, an excellent letter, which is looked upon as one of the finest monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity.Finding the Eusebians still obstinate, St. Julius moved Constans, Emperor of the West, to demand the concurrence of his brother Constantius in the assembling of a general council at Sardica in Illyricum. This was opened in May 347 and declared St. Athanasius and Marcellus of Ancyra orthodox and innocent, deposed certain Arian bishops, and framed twenty-one canons of discipline. St. Julius reigned fifteen years, two months, and six days. He passed away on April 12, 352 to join Christ and reign with the blessed in heaven. Numbered among the Church Triumphant, with his name written in the Book of Life, St. Julius intercedes for all who call out in Faith.</p>"

It would be better for that man if he had never been born.\"<br />Then Judas, his betrayer, said in reply, \"Surely it is not I, Rabbi?\" He answered, \"You have said so.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Hermenegild(Martyr (‚Ä† 586))</h3><p>SAINT HERMENEGILD Martyr ( 586) Leovigild, King of the Visigoths, had two sons, Hermenegild and Recared, who reigned conjointly with him. All three were Arians, but Hermenegild married a zealous Catholic, the daughter of Sigebert, King of France. By her holy example,Hermenegild was converted to the Faith. King Leovigild denounced Hermenegild's conversion and branded him a traitor, marching to seize the Prince. Hermenegild tried to rally the Catholics of Spain in his defence, but they were too weak to make any stand. After two years fruitless struggle, Hermenegild surrendered on the assurance of a free pardon. When safely in the royal camp, the King had Hermenegild loaded with fetters and cast into a foul dungeon at Seville. Despite the tortures and bribes employed to shake Hermenegild's faith, the Prince wrote toKing Leovigild that he considered the crown as nothing, and preferred to lose sceptre and life rather than betray the truth of God. At length, on Easter night, an Arian bishop entered the Prince's cell, and promised him pardon if he would but receive Communion at the Bishop's hands. Hermenegild rejected the offer; and soon after knelt with joy for his death-stroke. On the night of Hermenegild's execution, a light streaming from his cell told the Christians who were watching near that the martyr had won his crown, and was keeping his Easter with the Saints in glory. King Leovigild, on his death-bed, though still an Arian, bade his remaining son, Recared, to seek out St. Leander, whom he had persecuted. Following Hermenegild's example, King Leovigild converted and was received by St. Leander into the Church. After the King's death, Prince Recared labored so earnestly for the extirpation of Arianism that he brought over the whole nation of the Visigoths to the Church. \"Nor is it to be wondered,\" says St. Gregory, \"that he (Recared) came thus to be a preacher of the true faith, seeing that he was the brother of a martyr, whose merits did help him to bring so many into God's Church.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Martin I(Pope and Martyr (‚Ä† 656))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARTIN Pope and Martyr ( 656) St. Martin, who occupied the Roman See from AD 649 to 656, incurred the enmity of the Byzantine court by his energetic opposition to the Monothelite heresy. The Exarch Olympius went so far as to procure the assassination of the Pope at the Church of St. Mary Major; but the would-be murderer was miraculously struck blind, and his master refused to have any further hand in the matter. Olympius' successor had no such scruples: He seized Martin, and conveyed him on board a vessel bound for Constantinople. After a three-month voyage, the island of Naxos was reached, where the Pope was kept in confinement for a year, and finally, in 654, brought in chains to the imperial city. Pope Martin was then banished to the Tannic Chersonese, where he lingered on for four months, in sickness and starvation, till God released him by death in 656.</p>"

You may take it from either the sheep or the goats.<br />You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and then, with the whole assembly of Israel present, it shall be slaughtered during the evening twilight.<br />They shall take some of its blood and apply it to the two doorposts and the lintel of every house in which they partake of the lamb.<br />That same night they shall eat its roasted flesh with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br />\"This is how you are to eat it: with your loins girt, sandals on your feet and your staff in hand, you shall eat like those who are in flight. It is the Passover of the LORD.<br />For on this same night I will go through Egypt, striking down every first--born of the land, both man and beast, and executing judgment on all the gods of Egypt - I, the LORD!<br />But the blood will mark the houses where you are. Seeing the blood, I will pass over you; thus, when I strike the land of Egypt, no destructive blow will come upon you.<br />\"This day shall be a memorial feast for you, which all your generations shall celebrate with pilgrimage to the LORD, as a perpetual institution.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>116(115),12-13.15-16bc.17-18.</em><p>How shall I make a return to the LORD <br />for all the good he has done for me?<br />The cup of salvation I will take up, <br />and I will call upon the name of the LORD.<br />Precious in the eyes of the LORD <br />is the death of his faithful ones.<br />I am your servant, the son of your handmaid;<br />you have loosed my bonds.<br />To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, <br />and I will call upon the name of the LORD.<br />My vows to the LORD I will pay  <br />in the presence of all his people.  </p><h3>First Letter to the Corinthians</h3><em>11,23-26.</em><p>Brothers and sisters: I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over, took bread,<br />and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, \"This is my body that is for you.

Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"<br />For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>13,1-15.</em><p>Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come to pass from this world to the Father. He loved his own in the world and he loved them to the end.<br />The devil had already induced Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot, to hand him over. So, during supper,<br />fully aware that the Father had put everything into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God,<br />he rose from supper and took off his outer garments. He took a towel and tied it around his waist.<br />Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist.<br />He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Master, are you going to wash my feet?\"<br />Jesus answered and said to him, \"What I am doing, you do not understand now, but you will understand later.\"<br />Peter said to him, \"You will never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him, \"Unless I wash you, you will have no inheritance with me.\"<br />Simon Peter said to him, \"Master, then not only my feet, but my hands and head as well.\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"Whoever has bathed has no need except to have his feet washed, for he is clean all over; so you are clean, but not all.\"<br />For he knew who would betray him; for this reason, he said, \"Not all of you are clean.\"<br />So when he had washed their feet (and) put his garments back on and reclined at table again, he said to them, \"Do you realize what I have done for you?<br />You call me 'teacher' and 'master,' and rightly so, for indeed I am.<br />If I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet.<br />I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.</p><hr /><h3>St. Peter Gonzales(Dominican Priest (1190-1246))</h3><p>Saint Peter Gonzalez Dominican Priest (1190-1246) Peter Gonzales, also known as St. Elmo or St. Telmo, was born to a Castilian family of nobility. He was educated by his uncle, the Bishop of Astorga, named canon of the local cathedral, famous for his penances and mortifications, joined the Dominican Order, preached and made chaplain of the court of King St. Ferdinand III. He converted and influenced the soldiers of his country, evangelized, and died on Easter Sunday. Peter evangelized throughout his country and all along the coast. He had a special fondness for sailors. He used to visit them aboard their ships, preaching the Gospel and praying for their needs.</p><hr /><h3>St. Benezet (1165-1184)()</h3><hr /><p>SAINT BENEZET, or Little Bennet (1165-1184) St. Benezet kept his mother's sheep in the country, and as a mere child was devoted to practices of piety. As many persons were drowned in crossing the Rhone, Benezet was inspired by God to build a bridge over that rapid river at Avignon. He obtained the approbation of the bishop, proved his mission by miracles, and began the work in 1177, which he directed during seven years. He died when the difficulty of the undertaking was over, in 1184. This is attested by public monuments drawn up at that time and still preserved at Avignon, where the story is in everybody's month. His body was buried upon the bridge itself, which was not completely finished till four years after his decease, the structure whereof was attended with miracles from the first laying of the foundations till it was completed in 1188. Other miracles wrought after this at his tomb induced the city to build a chapel upon the bridge, in which his body lay nearly five hundred years. But in 1669 a greater part of the bridge falling down through the impetuosity of the waters, the coffin was taken up, and being opened in 1670 in presence of the grand vicar, during the vacancy of the archiepiscopal see, the body was found entire, without the least sign of corruption; even the bowels were perfectly sound, and the color of the eyes lively and sprightly, though, through the dampness of the situation, the iron bars about the coffin were much damaged with rust. The body was found in the same condition by the Archbishop of Avignon in 1674, when, accompanied by the Bishop of Orange and a great concourse of nobility, he performed the translation of it, with great pomp, into the Church of the Celestines, this Order having obtained of Louis XIV. the honor of being intrusted with the custody of his relics till such time as the bridge and chapel should be rebuilt.</p><hr /><h3>Sts.

To whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?<br />He grew up like a sapling before him, like a shoot from the parched earth; There was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him, nor appearance that would attract us to him.<br />He was spurned and avoided by men, a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity, One of those from whom men hide their faces, spurned, and we held him in no esteem.<br />Yet it was our infirmities that he bore, our sufferings that he endured, While we thought of him as stricken, as one smitten by God and afflicted.<br />But he was pierced for our offenses, crushed for our sins, Upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole, by his stripes we were healed.<br />We had all gone astray like sheep, each following his own way; But the LORD laid upon him the guilt of us all.<br />Though he was harshly treated, he submitted and opened not his mouth; Like a lamb led to the slaughter or a sheep before the shearers, he was silent and opened not his mouth.<br />Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away, and who would have thought any more of his destiny?

So if you are looking for me, let these men go.\"<br />This was to fulfill what he had said, \"I have not lost any of those you gave me.\"<br />Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus.<br />Jesus said to Peter, \"Put your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?\"<br />So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus, bound him,<br />and brought him to Annas first. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.<br />It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.<br />Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.<br />But Peter stood at the gate outside. So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.<br />Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, \"You are not one of this man's disciples, are you?\" He said, \"I am not.\"<br />Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire that they had made, because it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was also standing there keeping warm.<br />The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.<br />Jesus answered him, \"I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have said nothing.<br />Why ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.\"<br />When he had said this, one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\"<br />Jesus answered him, \"If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\"<br />Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.<br />Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm. And they said to him, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it and said, \"I am not.\"<br />One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \"Didn't I see you in the garden with him?\"<br />Again Peter denied it. And immediately the cock crowed.<br />Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was morning. And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.<br />So Pilate came out to them and said, \"What charge do you bring (against) this man?\"<br />They answered and said to him, \"If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.\"<br />At this, Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.\" The Jews answered him, \"We do not have the right to execute anyone,\"<br />in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he said indicating the kind of death he would die.<br />So Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"Do you say this on your own or have others told you about me?\"<br />Pilate answered, \"I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants (would) be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not here.\"<br />So Pilate said to him, \"Then you are a king?\" Jesus answered, \"You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\"<br />Pilate said to him, \"What is truth?\" When he had said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, \"I find no guilt in him.<br />But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\"<br />They cried out again, \"Not this one but Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.<br />Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.<br />And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak,<br />and they came to him and said, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" And they struck him repeatedly.<br />Once more Pilate went out and said to them, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.\"<br />So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, \"Behold, the man!\"<br />When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\"<br />The Jews answered, \"We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\"<br />Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid,<br />and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, \"Where are you from?\" Jesus did not answer him.<br />So Pilate said to him, \"Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you?\"<br />Jesus answered (him), \"You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\"<br />Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, \"If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.\"<br />When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge's bench in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.<br />It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon. And he said to the Jews, \"Behold, your king!\"<br />They cried out, \"Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your king?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\"<br />Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus,<br />and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.<br />There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.<br />Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, \"Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.\"<br />Now many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.<br />So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am the King of the Jews.'\"<br />Pilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\"<br />When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier. They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.<br />So they said to one another, \"Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,\" in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled (that says): \"They divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.\" This is what the soldiers did.<br />Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.<br />When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son.\"<br />Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother.\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br />After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I thirst.\"<br />There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth.<br />When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, \"It is finished.\" And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.<br />Now since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down.<br />So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.<br />But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs,<br />but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.<br />An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may (come to) believe.<br />For this happened so that the scripture passage might be fulfilled: \"Not a bone of it will be broken.\"<br />And again another passage says: \"They will look upon him whom they have pierced.\"<br />After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body.<br />Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds.<br />They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.<br />Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.<br />So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.</p><hr /><h3>St. Paternus(Bishop (5th century))</h3><p>SAINT PATERNUS Bishop (c. 482 - c. 550) St. Paternus was born at Poitiers, France about the year 482. His father, Patranus, with the consent of his wife, went into Ireland, where he ended his days in holy solitude. Paternus, fired by his example, embraced a monastic life in the abbey of Marnes. After some time, burning with a desire for perfect Christian virtue, he passed over to Wales, and in Cardiganshire (present-day Ceredigion), founded a monastery. The monastery was mentioned as Llan-patern-vaur, or the church of the great Paternus, but is today called St. Padarn's Church. Paternus made a visit to his father in Ireland, but being called back to his monastery of Marnes, he soon after retired with St. Scubilion, a monk of that house, and embraced an austere anchoretical life in the forests of Scicy (present-day Cerisy Forest), in the diocese of Coutances, near the sea - having first obtained leave of the bishop and of the lord of the place. This desert, which was then of great extent, but which has been since gradually gained upon by the sea, was anciently in great request among the Druids. St. Paternus converted the community of that and many neighboring parts, as far as Bayeux; and prevailed upon them to demolish a pagan temple used for votive offerings and human sacrifice. In his old age, Paternus was consecrated Bishop of Avranches by Germanus, Bishop of Rouen. Some false brethren having created a division of opinion among the bishops of the province with respect to St. Paternus, he preferred retiring rather than to afford any ground for dissension, and, after governing his diocese for thirteen years, withdrew to a solitude in France, where he passed away about the year 550.</p><hr /><h3>St. Anastasia()</h3><hr />"

Tell the Israelites to go forward.<br />And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea, split the sea in two, that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land.<br />But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and charioteers.<br />The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.\"<br />The angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp, now moved and went around behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them,<br />so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long.<br />Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided,<br />the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br />The Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea.<br />In the night watch just before dawn the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic;<br />and he so clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.<br />Then the LORD told Moses, \"Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and their charioteers.\"<br />So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst.<br />As the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped.<br />But the Israelites had marched on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br />Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians. When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore<br />and beheld the great power that the LORD had shown against the Egyptians, they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his servant Moses.<br />Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.</p><h3>Book of Exodus</h3><em>15,1b-2.3-4.5-6.17-18.</em><p>I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; <br />horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.<br />My strength and my courage is the LORD, <br />and he has been my savior. <br />He is my God, I praise him; <br />the God of my father, I extol him.<br />The LORD is a warrior, <br />LORD is his name!<br />Pharaoh's chariots and army he hurled into the sea; <br />the elite of his officers were submerged in the Red Sea.<br />The flood waters covered them, <br />they sank into the depths like a stone.<br />Your right hand, O LORD, magnificent in power, <br />your right hand, O LORD, has shattered the enemy.<br />And you brought them in and planted them <br />on the mountain of your inheritance‚Äî <br />the place where you made your seat, O LORD, <br />the sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands established.  <br />The LORD shall reign forever and ever.</p><h3>Letter to the Romans</h3><em>6,3-11.</em><p>Brothers and sisters: Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?<br />We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.<br />For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.<br />We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.<br />For a dead person has been absolved from sin.<br />If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.<br />We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has power over him.<br />As to his death, he died to sin once and for all; as to his life, he lives for God.<br />Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as (being) dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>24,1-12.</em><p>At daybreak on the first day of the week the women who had come from Galilee with Jesus took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.<br />They found the stone rolled away from the tomb;<br />but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.<br />While they were puzzling over this, behold, two men in dazzling garments appeared to them.<br />They were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground. They said to them, \"Why do you seek the living one among the dead?<br />He is not here, but he has been raised. Remember what he said to you while he was still in Galilee,<br />that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners and be crucified, and rise on the third day.\"<br />And they remembered his words.<br />Then they returned from the tomb and announced all these things to the eleven and to all the others.<br />The women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; the others who accompanied them also told this to the apostles,<br />but their story seemed like nonsense and they did not believe them.<br />But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, bent down, and saw the burial cloths alone; then he went home amazed at what had happened.</p><hr /><h3>St. Engratia(Virgin and Martyr and Eighteen Martyrs of Saragossa (+ 304))</h3><p>EIGHTEEN MARTYRS OF SARAGOSSA and ST. ENCRATIS, or ENGRATIA Virgin, Martyr (+ 304) During the persecution of Diocletian in 304, St. Optatus and seventeen other holy men received the crown of martyrdom on the same day at Saragossa. Two others, Caius and Crementius, were also martyred after a second persecution, dying from torture. Today, the Church also celebrates the victory of St. Encratis, or Engratia, a native of Portugal. Her father had promised her in marriage to a man of quality in Roussillon, but fearing the dangers, and despising the vanities of the world, she preserved her virginity in order to be more available to Jesus and serve Him without hindrance. Engratia stole away from her father's house and fled privately to Saragossa, where the persecution, under Governor Dacian, reached fever pitch. Engratia even reproached Governor Dacian for his barbarities, upon which he ordered her to be inhumanly tortured: Her sides were torn with iron hooks, and one of her breasts was cut off, so that the inner parts of her chest were exposed to view, and part of her liver was pulled out. In this condition, she was sent back to prison, being still alive, and died from her wounds in 304. The relics of all these martyrs were recovered at Saragossa in 1389.</p><hr /><h3>St. Bernadette Soubirous (of Lourdes)()</h3><hr /><p>St. Bernadette Soubirous (of Lourdes)Religious and Visionary (1844-1879) Bernadette was born in Lourdes, France, on January 7, 1844, the daughter of Francis and Louise Soubirous. Hard times had fallen on France and the family lived in extreme poverty. Bernadette was a sickly child. She contracted cholera as a toddler and suffered severe asthma for the rest of her life. Bernadette attended the day school conducted by the Sisters of Charity and Christian Instruction from Nevers. By the time of the events at the grotto, her family's financial and social status had declined to the point where they lived in a one-room basement, formerly used as a jail, called le cachot. On February 11, 1858, she was granted a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in a cave on the banks of the Gave River near Lourdes. She was placed in considerable jeopardy when she reported the vision, and crowds gathered when she had futher visits from the Virgin, from February 18 of that year through March 4.The civil authorities tried to frighten Bernadette into recanting her accounts, but she remained faithful to the vision. On February 25, Our Lady revealed a spring hidden below mud and debris in the cave and the waters were discovered to be of a miraculous nature, capable of healing the sick and lame.On March 25, Bernadette announced that in the vision Our Lady stated that she was the Immaculate Conception, which served as proof to the local priest of the veracity of her account. Our Lady asked that a church should be erected on the site, and for prayer and penance. Many authorities tried to shut down the spring and delay the construction of the chapel, but the influence and fame of the visions reached Empress Eugenie of France, wife of Napoleon III, and construction went forward. Crowds gathered, free of harassment from the anticlerical and antireligious officials. Disliking the attention she was attracting, Bernadette went to the hospice school run by the Sisters of Charity of Nevers where she finally learned to read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders.On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a postulant and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at Nevers. There she became a member of the community, and faced some rather harsh treatment from the mistress of novices. This oppression ended when it was discovered that she suffered from a painful, incurable illness. On her deathbed, as she suffered from severe pain and in keeping with the Virgin Mary's admonition of \"Penance, Penance, Penance,\" Bernadette proclaimed that \"all this is good for Heaven!\" Her final words were, \"Blessed Mary, Mother of God, pray for me! A poor sinner, a poor sinner-\" She passed away in Nevers on April 16, 1879. Lourdes became one of the major pilgrimage destinations in the world, and the spring has produced 27,000 gallons of water each week since emerging during Bernadette's visions. She was not involved in the building of the shrine, as she remained hidden in her monastic enclosure at Nevers. Bernadette was beatified in 1925 and canonized in 1933 by Pope Pius XI.</p>"

And this story has circulated among the Jews to the present (day).</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Marie-Anne Blondin()</h3><p>Bl. Marie-Anne BlondinReligious (1809 - 1890)Esther Blondin, in religion \"Sister Marie Anne\", was born in Terrebonne (Quebec, Canada) on April 18, 1809, in a family of deeply Christian farmers. From her mother she inherited a piety centered on Divine Providence and the Eucharist and, from her father, a deep faith and a strong patience in suffering. Esther and her family were victims of illiteracy so common in French Canadian milieux of the nineteenth century. Still an illiterate at the age of 22, Esther worked as a domestic in the Convent of the Sisters of the Congregation of Notre Dame, that had been recently opened in her own village. A year later, she registered as a boarder in order to learn to read and write. She then became a novice in the Congregation but had to leave, due to ill health.In 1833, Esther became a teacher in the parochial school of Vaudreuil. Little by little, she found out that one of the causes of this illiteracy was due to a certain Church ruling that forbade that girls be taught by men and that boys be taught by women. Unable to finance two schools, many parish priests chose to have none. In 1848, under an irresistible call of the Spirit, Esther presented to her Bishop, Ignace Bourget, a plan she long cherished: that of founding a religious congregation \"for the education of poor country children, both girls and boys in the same schools\". A rather new project for the time! It even seemed quite rash and contrary to the established order. Since the State was in favor of such schools, Bishop Bourget authorized a modest attempt so as to avoid a greater evil.The Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Anne was founded in Vaudreuil on September 8, 1850. Esther, now named \"Mother Marie Anne\", became its first superior. The rapid growth of this young Community soon required larger quarters. During the Summer of 1853, Bishop Ignace Bourget transferred the Motherhouse to Saint Jacques de l'Achigan. The new chaplain, Father Louis Adolphe Marechal, interfered in an abusive way in the private life of the Community. During the Foundress' absence, Father changed the pupils' boarding fees. Should he be away for a while, he asked that the Sisters await his return to go to confession. After a year of this existing conflict between the chaplain and the Foundress, the latter being anxious to protect the rights of her Community, Bishop Bourget asked Mother Marie Anne, on August 18, 1854, \"to resign\". He called for elections and warned Mother Marie Anne \"not to accept the superiorship, even if her sisters wanted to reelect her\". Even though she could be reelected, according to the Rule of the Community, Mother Marie Anne obeyed her Bishop whom she considered God's instrument. And she wrote: \"As for me, my Lord, I bless Divine Providence a thousand times for the maternal care she shows me in making me walk the way of tribulations and crosses\".Mother Marie Anne, having been named Directress at Saint Genevieve Convent, became the target of attacks from the Motherhouse authorities, influenced by the dictatorship of Father Marechal. Under the pretext of poor administration, Mother Marie Anne was recalled to the Motherhouse in 1858, with the Bishop's warning: \"take means so that she will not be a nuisance to anyone.\" From this new destitution and until her death on January 2, 1890, Mother Marie Anne was kept away from administrative responsibilities. She was even kept away from the General Council deliberations when the 1872 and 1878 elections reelected her. Assigned to mostly hidden work in the laundry and ironing room, she led a life of total self-denial and thus ensured the growth of the Congregation. Behold the paradox of an influence which some wanted to nullify! In the Motherhouse basement laundry room in Lachine, where she spent her days, many generations of novices received from the Foundress a true example of obedience and humility, imbued with authentic relationships which ensure true fraternal charity. To a novice who asked her one day why she, the Foundress, was kept aside in such lowly work, she simply replied with kindness : \"The deeper a tree sinks its roots into the soil, the greater are its chances of growing and producing fruit\".The attitude of Mother Marie Anne, who was a victim of so many injustices, allows us to bring out the evangelical sense she gave to events in her life. Just as Jesus Christ, who passionately worked for the Glory of His Father, so too Mother Marie Anne sought only God's Glory in all she did. \"The greater Glory of God\" was the aim she herself gave her Community. \"To make God known to the young who have not the happiness of knowing Him\" was for her a privileged way of working for the Glory of God. Deprived of her most legitimate rights, and robbed of all her personal letters with her bishop, she offered no resistance and she expected, from the infinite goodness of God, the solution to the matter. She was convinced that \"He will know well, in his Wisdom, how to discern the false from the true and to reward each one according to his deeds\".Prevented from being called \"Mother\" by those in authority, Mother Marie Anne did not jealously hold on to her title of Foundress; rather she chose annihilation, just like Jesus, \"her crucified Love\", so that her Community might live. However, she did not renounce her mission of spiritual mother of her Community. She offered herself to God in order \"to expiate all the sins which were committed in the Community\"; and she daily prayed Saint Anne \"to bestow on her spiritual daughters the virtues so necessary for Christian educators\".Like any prophet invested with a mission of salvation, Mother Marie Anne lived persecution by forgiving without restriction, convinced that \"there is more happiness in forgiving than in revenge\". This evangelical forgiveness, guarantee of \"the peace of soul which she held most precious\", was ultimately proven on her death bed when she asked her superior to call for Father Marechal \"for the edification of the Sisters\".As she felt the end approaching, Mother Marie Anne left to her daughters her spiritual testament in these words which are a resume of her whole life : \"May Holy Eucharist and perfect abandonment to God's Will be your heaven on earth\". She then peacefully passed away at the Motherhouse of Lachine, on January 2, 1890, \"happy to go to the Good God\" she had served all her life.</p><hr /><h3>St. Apollonius(Martyr (+ c. 186))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT APOLLONIUS Martyr (+ c. 186) Marcus Aurelius persecuted the Christians. The terror ended when Commodus, his son, stayed the persecution after becoming emperor in 180. Commodus ceased the state-enforced terror thanks to his Empress, Marcia. She admired the Faith and may have dialogued with Jesus in her heart. During the calm, the number of the faithful increased greatly. Many officials accepted and received faith in Jesus Christ through the intercession of Mama Mary and the Saints. One among the converts, a Roman senator named Apollonius, was a confessor for the faith. He was educated in philosophy, but also versed in Holy Scripture. His love for the Messiah was exceeding and bravely confessed without shame. An edict by former emperor Marcus Aurelius was still in effect which caused the accusers of Christians to be ensnared in the same punishment and execution. When one slave accused Apollonius of subversively practicing his faith, the accuser's legs were broken and he was soon after put to death. Apollonius was put on trial and led to his own Golgotha to share the Passion of the Lord. When a judge ordered Apollonius to renounce his faith in order to preserve both life and fortune, Apollonius bravely held fast, never selling out or betraying in the slightest his most dearly beloved. After refusing the terms of safety, Perennis referred Apollonius to the judgment of the Roman senate, where the latter gave an account of his faith. Apollonius spoke in defense of the Lamb of God, an innocent Man whom he loved. Jesus, \"the cornerstone\" stood by Apollonius in the brave Roman's trial. Apollonius was condemned by a decree of the Senate, and beheaded about the year 186. The sting of death separating soul and body issued Apollonius forth to eternal life - where, uninterrupted by the senses, he beholds God in a moment face to Face forever.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Savina Petrilli()</h3><hr /><p>Bl. Savina PetrilliReligious (1851 - 1923) At the age of ten, Savina Petrilli, of Siena, Italy, read a biography of Saint Catherine of Siena that instilled in her a lasting devotion to this saint. Savina thereafter aspired to imitate Catherine's devotion to the Eucharist, the Passion of Christ, and the Church. Following her First Holy Communion at the age of twelve, Savina became a frequent communicant. As a teenager, she was a very active member of a Marian sodality, the Children of Mary. At the age of eighteen, she had the opportunity to meet (Blessed) Pope Pius IX, who, upon learning that she was a native of Siena, commented that she should walk in Saint Catherine's footsteps. Savina saw in this remark a sign from heaven that inspired her to found a new religious congregation. She confided her plan to her dying sister Emilia, who in turn promised to assist in its accomplishment by her prayers in heaven. Savina's congregation received papal approbation in 1877 with the title, the Sisters of the Poor, devoted to the care of the needy. Mother Savina passed away from cancer on April 18, 1923, but continues interceeding for everyone who asks her with Faith.</p>"

He first became a monk in the monastery of Deerhurst, near Tewkesbury, England, and afterwards lived as a hermit near Bath, where he founded a community under the rule of St. Benedict and became its first abbot. At thirty years of age, he was chosen Bishop of Winchester, and twenty-two years later he became Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1011, when the Danes landed in Kent and took the city of Canterbury, putting all to fire and sword, St. Elphege was captured and carried off in the expectation of a large ransom. He was unwilling that his ruined church and people should be put to such expense, and was kept in a dark prison at Greenwich for seven months. While so confined, some friends came and urged him to lay a tax upon his tenants to raise the sum demanded for his ransom. \"What reward can I hope for,\" he said, \"if I spend upon myself what belongs to the poor? It's better to give them what's ours than to take from them the little that they own.\" As he still refused to give ransom, the enraged Danes fell upon him in a fury, beat him with the blunt sides of their weapons, and bruised him with stones until one, whom the Saint had baptized shortly before, put an end to his sufferings by the blow of an axe.He died on Easter Saturday, April 19, 1012, his last words being a prayer for his murderers. His body was first buried in St. Paul's, London, but was afterwards translated to Canterbury by King Canute. A church dedicated to St. Elphege still stands upon the place of his martyrdom at Greenwich.</p>"

With the help of Vincent and Domninus, he preached the Gospel to Celtic nations in Gaul and the Alps. Marcellinus later settled at Embrun and built a chapel. He would pass his nights in prayer after laboring all the day for the Gospel. By his pious example, through works and words in the spirit and fervor of the Saints, many pagans came to believe. \"The people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned\" (Is. 9:1-2, Mt. 4:16). Marcellinus was afterwards made bishop for those he had won over to Christ, but the date of his consecration is not positively known. Zealous for Christ and the Gospel, Bp. Marcellinus sometimes sent Vincent and Domninus to preach when he was unable to visit in person. Bp. Marcellinus passed away at Embrun about the year 374, and was there interred. St. Gregory of Tours, who speaks of Marcellinus in terms of highest praise, mentions many miracles at his tomb.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Clare Bosatta()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>St. Beuno()</h3><hr />"

When a boy of fifteen, being forbidden to enter religion, he lost his fervor and left home, and studied at various schools in France. At length, his vocation revived, and he became a monk at Bec in Normandy. The fame of his sanctity led William Rufus, when dangerously ill, to take him for his confessor and to name him to the vacant see of Canterbury. However, after recuperating, the king relapsed into his former sins, plundered the Church lands, scorned the archbishop's rebukes, and forbade him to go to Rome for the pallium. Abp. Anselm attended the pallium, and returned only to enter into a more bitter strife with William's successor, Henry I. Henry I claimed the right of investing prelates with the ring and crozier, symbols of the spiritual jurisdiction which belongs to the Church alone. Worldly prelates did not scruple to call Abp. Anselm a traitor for his defense of papal primacy and the Pope's supremacy. Speaking for his office in defense of his flock and the deposit of faith, Abp. Anselm exclaimed with calm dignity, \"If any man pretends that I violate my faith to my king because I will not reject the authority of the Holy See of Rome, let him stand forth, and in the name of God I will answer him as I ought.\" No one took up the challenge; and to the disappointment of the king, the barons sided with Abp. Anselm, respecting his courage and seeing that his cause was their own. Sooner than yield, the archbishop went again into exile, till at last the king was obliged to submit to the feeble yet inflexible old man. In the midst of his harassing cares, St. Anselm found time for writings which have made him celebrated as the father of scholastic theology; while in metaphysics and in science he had few equals.He is yet more famous for his devotion to our blessed Lady, whose Feast of the Immaculate Conception he was the first to establish in the West.</p>"

By the sweetness of his discourses, Pope Soter comforted all persons with the tenderness of a father, and assisted the indigent with liberal alms, especially those who suffered for the faith. According to the custom of his predecessors, Pope Soter liberally extended his charities to remote churches. In thanksgiving, St. Dionysius of Corinth writes that the Pope's letter was read during Sunday assemblies, together with the letter of Pope St. Clement I. St. Soter steadfastly opposed the heresy of Montanus. He governed the Church until being martyred in 175. He is included in the list of the Church's first thirty-one popes, all of whom were martyred.</p><hr /><h3>St. Leonides(Martyr (+ 202))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT LEONIDES Martyr (+ 202) The Emperor Severus, in the year 202, during the tenth of his reign, raised a bloody persecution, which filled the whole empire with martyrs, but especially in Egypt. One renowned martyr, whose triumph ennobled and edified the city of Alexandria, was Leonides, father of the great Origen. Leonides was a Christian philosopher learned in both the profane and sacred sciences. He had seven sons whom he raised with abundant care. The eldest son, Origen, took after his father with a love for learning and piety. Leonides loved his children with paternal affection, seeing each as a temple of the Holy Spirit. When the persecution raged at Alexandria under L√¶tus, the governor of Egypt, Leonides was cast into prison. Origen, who was then only seventeen, burned with fearless zeal for the Gospel, but was spared martyrdom for some cosmic design he could discern at the time. Cautioned and impelled by his mother toward temperance and daring rather than recklessness, Origen cared for his family and his mother's well-being. He then wrote to his father in very moving terms, strongly exhorting him to look on the crown that was offered him with courage and joy, adding this clause, \"Take heed, sir, that for our sakes you do not change your mind.\" Leonides was accordingly beheaded for the faith in 202. His estates and goods were confiscated and his widow was left with seven children to maintain in the poorest condition imaginable. Divine Providence was both her comfort and support; and the Lord worked great signs through her family and children. The extant works of Origen inspired Christian Science and formed Christian thought and doctrine.</p><hr /><h3>St. Teodore of Sykeon()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

In early youth, he chose a soldier's life, and soon obtained the favor of an Officer Diocletian, who advanced him to the rank of tribune. When, however, the emperor began to persecute the Christians, George rebuked Diocletian for his cruelty. In retaliation, Diocletian had George tortured, and at length beheaded. There was something so inspiriting in the defiant cheerfulness of the young soldier, that every Christian felt a personal share in this triumph of Christian fortitude; and as years rolled on, St. George became a type of successful combat against evil, the slayer of the dragon, the darling theme of camp song and story, until \"so thick a shade his very glory round him made\" that his real lineaments became hard to trace. Even beyond the circle of Christendom, he was held in honor, and invading Saracens taught themselves to except from desecration the image of him they hailed as the \"White-horsed Knight.\" The devotion to St. George is one of the most ancient and widely spread in the Church. In the East, a church of St. George is ascribed to Constantine, and his name is invoked in the most ancient liturgies; whilst in the West, Malta, Barcelona, Valencia, Arragon, Genoa, and England have chosen him as their patron.</p><hr /><h3>St. Adalbert()</h3><hr />"

He was named Angelo Ercole - Ercole being Italian for \"Hercules.\" He was the fifth of fifteen children born to Luigi Menni and Luisa Figini. His warm and hospitable home gave him the support and stimulus he needed to develop character and virtues. God's call came early on: faithful to his conscience, he gave up a good position in a bank, and with his selfless attitude to the suffering he volunteered to work as a stretcher-bearer to assist the soldiers wounded on the battlefield at Magenta, near Milan. The spirit of dedication and self-denial of the Brothers of St John of God attracted our future saint, and at the age of nineteen he applied to enter the Hospitaller Order. Taking the name Benedict, he was consecrated to God and caring for the sick.His Hospitaller formation and mission Benedict's vocation as Hospitaller was revealed through his care for the wounded and ill. Not only did he place himself at the service of all, but he was loyal to his superiors. At the time, Spain - the cradle of the Hospitaller Order - was embroiled in political strife with open hostility to all religious orders, and the work of St. John of God was in jeopardy. Taking the bull by the horns - taking the helm of the ship - St. Benedict stepped in to fill crucial responsibilities and rejuvenated the order. Being sent to Spain in 1867, St. Benedict both restored the order of St. John of God and founded the Congregation of the Hospitaller Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.Restoration of the Hospitaller Order Sent to Spain by the Prior General of the Order, Fr Giovanni M. Alfieri, who always supported him, and with the blessing of Pope Visitor and Prior General of the Order Pius IX, even before he left Rome Benedict Menni demonstrated a will of iron and a determined spirit. Only a few months after his arrival in Spain he set up his first children's hospital in Barcelona (1867), marking the beginning of his extraordinary work of restoration, which he was to carry through over the next 36 years. From the first moment, thanks to his commitment to his vocation, numerous generous followers rallied around him, and it was through them that he was able to guarantee continuity to his new Hospitaller institutions that were springing up in Spain, Portugal and Mexico, to spread subsequently throughout the New World.Foundation of the Hospitaller Sisters When he arrived in Granada (1878), Benedict Menni came in contact with two young women, Maria Josefa Recio and Maria Angtistias Gimenez, who set up a new women's hospital specifically to provide psychiatric care in 1881. The Mother House of the \"Congregation of the Hospitaller Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus\" was founded at Ciempozuelos, Madrid and received the approval of the Holy See in 1901. Six words summarize their identity in the Hospitaller service: \"pray, work, endure, suffer, a love God and silence\". The new institution soon spread its wings by becoming established in several countries in Europe and Latin America, and later on in Africa and Asia. Today, as the Congregation celebrates the canonization of its founder, Benedict Menni, the Sisters are present in 24 countries, with over 100 Hospitaller centres.Visitor and Prior General of the Order Benedict Menni's opera magna spread, at the request of the Holy See, to the whole Order when he was appointed Apostolic Visitor (1909-1911) and subsequently Prior General (1911), which he had to resign one year later as a result of misunderstandings and for health reasons. He spent the last two years of his life in humility and purification, and died a holy death at Dinan, France, on 24 April 1914. His mortal remains were taken by the Spanish Brothers to Ciempozuelos, and today are venerated under the high altar in the Founders' Chapel in the Hospitaller Sisters' Mother House there.In the glory of the saints The process for St. Benedict's canonization opened from 1945-1947 in the diocese of Madrid, where he is buried. On May 11, 1982 the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints recognized Benedict's virtues as heroic, and assigned to him the posthumous title of \"Venerable.\" Following the official acceptance of the miraculous healing of Asuncion Cacho thanks to St. Benedict's intercession, Fr. Benedict was proclaimed \"Blessed\" in St. Peter's Basilica on June 23, 1985, and \"Saint\" on November 21, 1999 by Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Fidelis of Sigmaringen(Martyr (1577-1622))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Fidelis of Sigmaringen Capuchin Priest and Martyr (1577-1622) St. Fidelis was born in Sigmaringen, Southern Germany to a noble family in 1577. He frequently received the sacraments, visited the sick and the poor, and spent hours praying at the altar. For a time, he followed the legal profession and was remarkable for his advocacy of the poor and his respectful language towards opponents. Finding it difficult to become both a rich lawyer and a good Christian, Fidelis entered the Capuchin Order. True to his calling, he embraced a life of austerity and prayer, performing voluntary self-disciplines for the sake of all suffering souls. Having been sent to Switzerland by the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, Father Fidelis braved every peril and drew souls from Calvinism to the Church founded by Jesus Himself. When preaching at Seewis im Pr√°ttigau, he was shot by Calvinist nationalists. Undeterred, Fr. Fidelis continued preaching, and was lynched. When Fr. Fidelis refused to apostate, the lynch mob hacked and cut him to death with swords. Death did not stop Fr. Fidelis' love. A martyr, he reigns in heaven with our Lord forever. In recognition of his heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from his intercession, Pope Benedict XIV canonized St. Fidelis on June 29, 1746.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Maria Elisabetta Hesselblad (1870-1957)()</h3><hr /><p>BLESSED MARIA ELISABETTA HESSELBLAD (1870-1957) Maria Elisabetta Hesselblad was born in the little village of Faglavik, in the province of Alvsborg, Sweden on June 4, 1870. The following month, she was baptized and received into the Reformed Church of Sweden in her parish in Hundene. She was the fifth of thirteen children born to Augusto Roberto Hesselblad and Cajsa Pettesdotter Dag. Her childhood was lived out in various places because economic difficulties forced the family to move on several occasions. In 1886, in order to make a living and to support her family, she went to work first of all in Karlosborg and then in the United States of America. She went to nursing school at the Roosevelt hospital in New York and dedicated herself to home care of the sick. This meant that she continually had to make many sacrifices, which did not do her health any good, but certainly helped her soul to flourish. The contact she had with so many sick Catholics and her thirst for truth helped to keep alive in her heart her search for the true flock of Christ. Through prayer, personal study and a deep daughterly devotion to the Mother of the Redeemer, she was decisively led to the Catholic Church and, on the 15 August 1902, in the Convent of the Visitation in Washington, she received conditional baptism from Fr. Giovani Giorgio Hagen, S.J., who also became her spiritual director. Looking back on that moment of grace, she wrote, \"In an instant the love of God was poured over me. I understood that I could respond to that love only through sacrifice and a love prepared to suffer for His glory and for the Church. Without hesitation I offered Him my life, and my will to follow Him on the Way of the Cross.\" Two days later, she was nourished by the Eucharist, and then she left for Europe. In Rome, she received the Sacrament of Confirmation, and she clearly perceived that she was to dedicate herself to the unity of Christians. She also visited the church and house of Saint Bridget of Sweden (+ 1373), and came away with a deep and lasting impression: \"It is in this place that I want you to serve me.\" She returned to the United States, and her fragile health notwithstanding, she left everything on 25 March 1904 to settle in Rome at the Casa di Santa Brigida, receiving a wonderful welcome from the Carmelite Nuns who lived there. In silence and in prayer, she made great progress in knowledge and love of Christ. She fostered devotion to Saint Bridget and Saint Catherine of Sweden, and nourished a growing concern for her people and the Church. In 1906, Pope Saint Pius X allowed her to take the habit of the Order of the Most Holy Saviour of Saint Bridget and profess vows as a spiritual daughter of the Swedish saint. In the years that followed, she strove to bring back to Rome the Order of the Most Holy Saviour, and to that end she visited the few existing Brigettine monasteries in Europe, an experience that brought joys, disappointments and no concrete help. Her dream of bringing to birth a Brigettine community in Rome that was made up of members coming from monasteries of ancient observance, was not realized. However Divine Providence, in ways that were quite unexpected, enabled a new branch to grow from the ancient Brigettine trunk. In fact, on the 9 November 1911, the Servant of God welcomed three young English postulants and refounded the Order of the Most Holy Saviour of Saint Bridget, whose particular mission was to pray and work, especially for the unity of Scandinavian Christians with the Catholic Church. In 1931, she experienced the great joy of receiving the Holy See's permission to have permanent use of the church and house of Saint Bridget in Rome. These became the centre of activity for the Order which, driven on by its missionary zeal, also established foundations in India (1937). During and after the Second World War, the Servant of God performed great works of charity on behalf of the poor and those who suffered because of racial laws. She promoted a movement for peace that involved catholics and non-catholics; she multiplied her ecumenical endeavours; and for many people who belonged to other religions or other christian confessions, she was part of their journey towards the Catholic Church. From the very beginning of her Foundation, she was particularly attentive to the formation of her spiritual daughters, for whom she was both a mother and a guide. She implored them to live in close union with God, to have a fervent desire to be conformed to our Divine Saviour, to possess a great love for the Church and the Roman Pontiff, and to pray constantly that there be only one flock and one shepherd, adding, \"This is the prime goal of our vocation.\" She also devoted herself to fostering a unity of spirit within the Order. \"The Lord has called us from different nations,\" she wrote, \"but we must be united with one heart and one soul. In the divine Heart of Jesus we will always meet one another and there we seek our strength to face the difficulties of life. May we be strengthened to practice the beautiful virtues of charity, humility and patience. Then our religious life will be the antechamber to Heaven.\" On other occasions she said, \"Our religious houses must be formed after the example of Nazareth: prayer, work, sacrifice. The human heart can aspire to nothing greater.\" Throughout her life, she remained faithful to what she had written in 1904: \"Dear Lord, I do not ask to see the path. In darkness, in anguish and in fear, I will hang on tightly to your hand and I will close my eyes, so that you know how much trust I place in you, Spouse of my soul.\" Hope in God and in His providence supported her in every moment, especially in times of testing, solitude and the cross. She put the things of Heaven before the things of earth, God's will before her own, the good of her neighbour before her own benefit. Contemplating the infinite love of the Son of God, who sacrificed Himself for our salvation, she fed the flame of love in her heart, as manifested by the goodness of her works. Repeatedly to her daughters she said, \"We must nourish a great love for God and our neighbors; a strong love, an ardent love, a love that burns away imperfections, a love that gently bears an act of impatience, or a bitter word, a love that lets an inadvertence or act of neglect pass without comment, a love that lends itself readily to an act of charity.\" The Servant of God was like a garden in which the sun of charity brought to bloom the flowers of the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. She was filled with care and concern for her Sisters, for the poor, the sick, the persecuted Jewish people, for priests, for the children to whom she taught Christian doctrine, for her family and for the people of Sweden and Rome. She was a humble Sister and most obliging to all who sought her help. She always felt a sense of duty and great joy in sharing with others the gifts she had received from the Lord, and this she did with gentleness, graciousness and simplicity. She was prudent in her work for the Kingdom of God, in her speaking, acting, advising and correcting. She had great respect for the religious freedom of non-christians and non-catholics, whom she received gladly under her roof. She practiced justice towards God and neighbour, temperance, self-control, reserve, detachment from the honours and things of the world, humility, chastity, obedience, fortitude in tribulation, perseverance in her praise and service of God, and faithfulness to her religious consecration. She walked with God, clinging to the cross of Christ, who was her companion from the days of her youth. \"For me,\" she said, \"the way of the Cross has been the most beautiful of all because on this path I have met and known my Lord and Saviour.\" Unremittingly, her physical suffering went hand in hand with her moral suffering. The cross became particularly heavy and painful during the final years of her life, when the Holy See prepared the Canonical Visit of her Order as her health got progressively worse. In prayer and peaceful submission to God's will, she prepared herself for the final meeting with the Divine Spouse, who called her to Himself in the early hours of April 24, 1957. The reputation for holiness which surrounded her in life increased after her death; and almost immediately, the Vicariate of Rome began the cause for Beatification. She was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on April 9, 2000 at Rome.</p>"

Amen.<br />I write you this briefly through Silvanus, whom I consider a faithful brother, exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Remain firm in it.<br />The chosen one at Babylon sends you greeting, as does Mark, my son.<br />Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>89(88),2-3.6-7.16-17.</em><p>The favors of the LORD I will sing forever; <br />through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.<br />For you have said, ‚ÄúMy kindness is established forever‚Äù; <br />in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.<br />The heavens proclaim your wonders, O LORD, <br />and your faithfulness, in the assembly of the holy ones.<br />For who in the skies can rank with the LORD? <br />Who is like the LORD among the sons of God?<br />Blessed the people who know the joyful shout; <br />in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.<br />At your name they rejoice all the day, <br />and through your justice they are exalted.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>16,15-20.</em><p>Jesus said to the eleven: \"Go into the whole world and proclaim the Gospel to every creature.<br />Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved; whoever does not believe will be condemned.<br />These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will drive out demons, they will speak new languages.<br />They will pick up serpents (with their hands), and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not harm them.

When St. Peter was writing his first epistle to the churches of Asia, he affectionately joins with his own salutation that of his faithful companion, whom he calls \"my son Mark.\" The Roman people entreated St. Mark to put in writing for them the substance of St. Peter's frequent discourses on Our Lord's life. This the Evangelist did under the eye and with the express sanction of the apostle, and every page of his brief but graphic gospel so bore the impress of St. Peter's character, that the Fathers used to name it \"Peter's Gospel\" St. Mark was now sent to Egypt to found the Church of Alexandria. Here, his disciples became the wonder of the world for their piety and asceticism, so that St. Jerome speaks of St. Mark as the father of the anchorites, who at a later time thronged the Egyptian deserts. Here, too, he set up the first Christian school, the fruitful mother of many illustrious doctors and bishops. After governing his see for many years, St. Mark was one day seized by a pagan mob, dragged by ropes over stones, and thrown into prison. On the morrow, the torture was repeated, and having been consoled by a vision of angels and the voice of Jesus, St. Mark went to his reward. It is to St. Mark that we owe the many slight touches which often give such vivid coloring to the Gospel scenes, and help us to picture the very gestures and looks of our blessed Lord. He alone notes that in the temptation, Jesus was \"with the beasts;\" that he slept in the boat \"on a pillow;\" that he \"embraced\" the little children.He alone preserves for us the commanding words, \"Peace, be still!\" by which the storm was quelled; or even the very sounds of his voice, the \"Ephpheta\" and \"Talitha cumi,\" by which the dumb were made to speak and the dead to rise. Jesus' \"looking round about with anger,\" and the \"sighing deeply,\" long treasured in the memory of the penitent apostle St. Peter, who was himself converted by his Saviour's look, are here recorded by his faithful interpreter.</p>"

He was baptised and confirmed in Burgos and began his schooling at the Jesuit college in the same city. In 1919, he was admitted to first Communion. It was at this time that he had his first experience of illness. Persistent fevers due to colibacillosis forced him to interrupt his studies. To mark his recovery, which he attributed to a special intervention of the Virgin Mary, his father took him to Zaragoza and consecrated him to the Virgin of Pilar. This experience, which took place in the late summer of 1921, profoundly affected Raphael. When the family moved to Oviedo, he continued his secondary schooling with the Jesuits there, obtaining a diploma in science. He then enrolled in the School of Architecture in Madrid where he succeeded in balancing his studies with a life of fervent piety. Possessing a brilliant and eclectic mind, Raphael also stood out because of his deep sense of friendship and his fine features. Blessed with a happy and jovial nature, he was also athletic, had a gift for drawing and painting as well a love for music and the theatre. As he matured, his spiritual experience of the Christian life deepened. Although the study of architecture required a great deal of hard work and discipline, at that time he began the practice of making a long daily visit to the Blessed Sacrament in the Chapel of Caballero de Gracia. He even joined the Nocturnal Adoration Association, and faithfully took his turn before the Blessed Sacrament.In this way, his heart became well disposed to listening, and he perceived an invitation from God to lead the contemplative life. Raphael had already been in contact with the Trappist monastery of San Isidro de Due√±as, and he felt strongly drawn to this place, responding to his deepest desires. In December of 1933, he suddenly broke off his professional studies and on January 16, 1934 entered the monastery of San Isidro. After the first months of the noviciate and his first Lent, which he lived with great enthusiasm, embracing all the austerities of Trappist life, God mysteriously chose to test him with a sudden and painfulinfirmity: a serious form of diabetes mellitus which forced him to leave the monastery immediately and return to his family in order to receive the proper care. Barely recovered, he returned to the monastery, but his illness forced him to leave the monastery for treatment again and again. But whenever he was absent he wanted to return, responding faithfully and generously to what he understood to be a call from God. Sanctified by his joyful and heroic fidelity to his vocation, in his loving acceptance of the Divine will and the mystery of the Cross, in his impassioned search for the Face of God, fascinated by his contemplation of the Absolute, in his tender and filial devotion to the Virgin Mary - \"the Lady\", as he liked to call her - his life came to an end on April 26, 1938. He was barely 27 years old. He was buried in the monastery cemetery, and later in the Abbey church. The fame of his sanctity rapidly spread beyond the walls of the monastery. The example of his life together with his many spiritual writings continue to spread and greatly profit those who get to know him. He has been described as one of the great mystics of the twentieth century. On August 19, 1989, the Holy Father St. John Paul II, on World Youth Day at Santiago de Compostella, proposed him as a model for young people today, and beatified him on September 27, 1992.St. Raphael was canonized on October 11, 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI. The Pope presented him as a friend and intercessor for all the faithful, especially for the young.</p><hr /><h3>St. Cletus(Pope and Martyr (+ c. 88))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT CLETUS Pope and Martyr (+ c. 88) St. Cletus was the third Bishop of Rome, and succeeded St. Linus. Circumstances alone show his eminent virtue among the first disciples of St. Peter in the West. He sat twelve years, from 76 to 88. The canon of the Roman Mass, Bede, and other martyrologists, style him a martyr. He was buried near St. Linus in the Vatican, and his relics still remain in that church.</p><hr /><h3>St. Marcellinus(Pope and Martyr (+ 304))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARCELLINUS Pope and Martyr (+ 304) St. Marcellinus succeeded St. Coins in the bishopric of Rome in 296, about the time that Diocletian set himself up for a deity, and impiously claimed divine honors. In those stormy times of persecution, Marcellinus acquired great glory. He sat in St. Peter's chair eight years, three months, and twenty-five days, dying in 304, a year after the persecution broke out. He was killed for declaring Jesus is the True and Living God. St. Marcellius knew beforehand that confessing his love would mean his end. Like Jesus, he lay down his life for us; you and I, the church and the people of Christ. His intercession remains open for all who believe. From his authenticity, we may conclude that he asked St. Joseph for intercession and manliness; and the Blessed Virgin to guide his hands and all his works, consecrating himself to Her.</p>"

During this time, she rose each morning, while the household was asleep, to hear Mass, and then toiled incessantly till night came, doing the work of others as well as her own. Once, absorbed in prayer, Zita remained in church past the usual hour of her bread-making. She hastened home, reproaching herself with neglect of duty, and found the bread made and ready for the oven. She never doubted that her mistress or one of her servants had kneaded it, and going to them, thanked them; but they were astonished. No human being had made the bread. A delicious perfume rose from it, for angels had made it during her prayer. Whenever Zita's master and mistress treated her as a mere drudge, or her fellow-servants resented her diligence, Zita united these sufferings with those of Christ her Lord. She never changed the tone of her voice nor forgot her gentle and quiet ways. At length, Fatinelli, seeing the success which attended Zita's undertakings, gave her charge of his children and of the household. She was apprehensive at first, but scrupulously fulfilled her trust. By her holy economy, her master's goods were multiplied, while the poor were fed at his door. Gradually, her unfailing patience conquered the jealousy of her fellow-servants, and she became their advocate with their hot-tempered master, who dared not give way to his anger before Zita. In the end, her prayer and toil sanctified the whole house, and drew down upon it the benediction of Heaven. She passed away in 1278, and in the moment of her death a bright star appearing above her attic showed that she had gained eternal rest.</p><hr /><h3>St. Liberale()</h3><hr />"

He was known in his time as a preacher and was made a missionary apostolic by Pope Clement XI. He was born in Montfort-sur-Meu, the eldest surviving child of eighteen born to Jean-Baptiste and Jeanne Robert Grignion. His father was a notary. Louis-Marie passed most of his infancy and early childhood in Iffendic, a few kilometers from Montfort, where his father had bought a farm. At the age of 12, he entered the Jesuit College of St Thomas Becket in Rennes, where his uncle was a parish priest. He was then given the opportunity, through a benefactor, to go to Paris to study at the renowned Seminary of Saint-Sulpice. When he arrived in Paris, it was to find that his benefactor had not provided enough money for him, so he lodged in a succession of boarding houses, living among the very poor, in the meantime attending lectures in theology. After less than two years, he became very ill and had to be hospitalized.He was ordained a priest in June 1700, and assigned to Nantes. His letters of this period show that he felt frustrated from the lack of opportunity to preach as he felt he was called to do. He considered various options, even that of becoming a hermit, but the conviction that he was called to \"preach missions to the poor\" increased. In November 1700 he joined the Third Order of the Dominicans and asked permission not only to preach the rosary, but to also form rosary confraternities. The same month he wrote::\"I am continually asking in my prayers for a poor and small company of good priests to preach missions and retreats under the standard and protection of the Blessed Virgin\". This initial thought eventually led to the formation of the Company of Mary.The bishop of La Rochelle invited him to open a school in his diocese. Montfort enlisted the help of his follower Marie Louise Trichet who was then running the General Hospital in Poitiers. In 1715 Marie Louise and Catherine Brunet left Poitiers for La Rochelle to open the school there and in a short time it had 400 students. On August 22, 1715, Blessed Marie Louise Trichet and Catherine Brunet, along with Marie Valleau and Marie R√©gnier from La Rochelle received the approbation of Bishop de Champflour of La Rochelle to perform their religious profession under the direction of Montfort. At the ceremony Montfort told them: \"Call yourselves the Daughters of Wisdom, for the teaching of children and the care of the poor.\" The Daughters of Wisdom grew into an international organization and the placing of Montfort's founders statue in Saint Peter's Basilica was based on that organization.As well as preaching, Montfort found time to write a number of books which went on to become classic Catholic titles and influenced several popes. Montfort is known for his particular devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary and the practice of praying the Rosary. Montfort is considered as one of the early writers in the field of Mariology. His most notable works regarding Marian devotions are contained in The Secret of Mary and the True Devotion to Mary.The Roman Catholic Church, under the pontificate of Pope Pius XII canonized Montfort on July 20, 1947.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gianna Beretta Molla (1922-1962)()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Gianna Beretta Molla (1922-1962) Gianna Beretta was born in Magenta (Milan) on October 4, 1922. As a youth, she willingly accepted the gift of faith and the clearly Christian education she received from her parents. As a result, she experienced life as a marvellous gift from God, had a strong faith in Providence and was convinced of the necessity and effectiveness of prayer. She diligently dedicated herself to studies during the years of her secondary and university education, while, at the same time, applying her faith through generous apostolic service among the youth of Catholic Action and charitable work among the elderly and needy as a member of the St. Vincent de Paul Society. After earning degrees in Medicine and Surgery from the University of Pavia in 1949, she opened a medical clinic in Mesero (near Magenta) in 1950. She specialized in Pediatrics at the University of Milan in 1952, and there after gave special attention to mothers, babies, the elderly and poor. While working in the field of medicine, which she considered a \"mission\" and practiced as such, she increased her generous service to Catholic Action, especially among the \"very young\" and, at the same time, expressed her joie de vivre and love of creation through skiing and mountaineering. Through her prayers and those of others, she reflected upon her vocation, which she also considered a gift from God. Having chosen the vocation of marriage, she embraced it with complete enthusiasm and wholly dedicated herself \"to forming a truly Christian family.\" She became engaged to Pietro Molla and was radiant with joy and happiness during the time of their engagement, for which she thanked and praised the Lord. They were married on September 24, 1955, in the Basilica of St. Martin in Magenta, and she became a happy wife. In November 1956, to her great joy, she became the mother of Pierluigi; in December 1957, of Mariolina; in July 1959 of Laura. With simplicity and equilibrium, she harmonized the demands of mother, wife, doctor and her passion for life. In September 1961,h towards the end of the second month of pregnancy, she was touched by suffering and the mystery of pain; she had developed a fibroma in her uterus. Before the required surgical operation, and conscious of the risk that her continued pregnancy brought, she pleaded with the surgeon to save the life of the child she was carrying, and entrusted herself to prayer and Providence. The life was saved, for which she thanked the Lord. She spent the seven months remaining until the birth of the child in incomparable strength of spirit and unrelenting dedication to her tasks as mother and doctor. She worried that the baby in her womb might be born in pain, and she asked God to prevent that. A few days before the child was due, although trusting as always in Providence, she was ready to give her life in order to save that of her child: \"If you must decided between me and the child, do not hesitate: choose the child - I insist on it. Save him\". On the morning of April 21, 1962, Gianna Emanuela was born. Despite all efforts and treatments to save both of them, on the morning of April 28, amid unspeakable pain and after repeated exclamations of \"Jesus, I love you. Jesus, I love you,\" the mother died. She was 39 years old. Her funeral was an occasion of profound grief, faith and prayer. The Servant of God lies in the cemetery of Mesero, 4 km from Magenta. \"Conscious immolation\" was the phrase used by Pope Paul VI to define the act of Blessed Gianna, remembering her at the Sunday Angelus of September 23, 1973, as: \"A young mother from the diocese of Milan, who, to give life to her daughter, sacrificed her own, with conscious immolation.\" The Holy Father in these words clearly refers to Christ on Calvary and in the Eucharist. Gianna was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on April 24, 1994, and officially canonized a saint on May 16, 2004. St. Gianna's husband Pietro and their last child, Gianna, were present at the canonization ceremony.</p><hr /><h3>St. Peter Chanel()</h3><hr /><p>St. Peter Chanel, Priest and Martyr (1803 - April 28, 1841) The protomartyr of the South Seas, St. Peter Chanel was born in 1803 at Clet in the diocese of Belley, France. His intelligence and simple piety brought him to the attention of the local priest, Fr. Trompier, who saw to his elementary education. Entering the diocesan Seminary, Peter won the affection and the esteem of both students and professors. After his ordination, Fr. Peter completely revitalized a rundown country parish in the three he was there. However, his mind was set on missionary work. In 1831, he joined the newly formed Society of Mary (Marists) that concentrated on missionary work at home and abroad. To his dismay, he was appointed to teach at the seminary at Belley and remained there for the next five years, diligently performing his duties. In 1836, the Society was given the New Hebrides in the Pacific as a field for evangelization, and the jubilant St. Peter was appointed Superior of a little band of missionaries sent to proclaim the Faith to its inhabitants. On reaching their destination after an arduous ten-month journey, the band split up and St. Peter went to the Island of Futuna accompanied by a laybrother and an English layman, Thomas Boog. They were at first well-received by the people and their king Niuliki who had only recently forbidden canabalism. However, the king's jealousy and fear were aroused when the missionaries learned the language and gained the people's confidence. Niuliki realized the adoption of the Christian Faith would lead to the abolition of some of the prerogatives he enjoyed as both highpriest and sovereign. Finally, when Niuliki's own son expressed a desire to be baptized, the king's hatred erupted and he dispatched a group of his warriors to set upon the missionaries. Thus, on April 28, 1841, three years after his arrival, St. Peter was seized and clubbed to death by those he had come to save. St. Peter's death brought his work to completion - within five months the entire island was converted to Christianity.</p>"

He also drew people after him, but he too perished and all who were loyal to him were scattered.<br />So now I tell you, have nothing to do with these men, and let them go. For if this endeavor or this activity is of human origin, it will destroy itself.<br />But if it comes from God, you will not be able to destroy them; you may even find yourselves fighting against God.\" They were persuaded by him.<br />After recalling the apostles, they had them flogged, ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.<br />So they left the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been found worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name.<br />And all day long, both at the temple and in their homes, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the Messiah, Jesus.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>27(26),1.4.13-14.</em><p>The LORD is my light and my salvation; <br />whom should I fear? <br />The LORD is my life's refuge; <br />of whom should I be afraid?<br />One thing I ask of the LORD <br />this I seek: <br />to dwell in the house of the LORD <br />all the days of my life, <br />that I may gaze on the loveliness of the LORD <br />and contemplate his temple.  <br />I believe that I shall see the bounty of the LORD <br />in the land of the living.<br />Wait for the LORD with courage; <br />be stouthearted, and wait for the LORD.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>6,1-15.</em><p>Jesus went across the Sea of Galilee.<br />A large crowd followed him, because they saw the signs he was performing on the sick.<br />Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.<br />The Jewish feast of Passover was near.<br />When Jesus raised his eyes and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, he said to Philip, \"Where can we buy enough food for them to eat?\"<br />He said this to test him, because he himself knew what he was going to do.<br />Philip answered him, \"Two hundred days' wages worth of food would not be enough for each of them to have a little (bit).\"<br />One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, said to him,<br />There is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what good are these for so many?<br />Jesus said, \"Have the people recline.\" Now there was a great deal of grass in that place. So the men reclined, about five thousand in number.<br />Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were reclining, and also as much of the fish as they wanted.<br />When they had had their fill, he said to his disciples, \"Gather the fragments left over, so that nothing will be wasted.\"<br />So they collected them, and filled twelve wicker baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves that had been more than they could eat.<br />When the people saw the sign he had done, they said, \"This is truly the Prophet, the one who is to come into the world.\"<br />Since Jesus knew that they were going to come and carry him off to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain alone.</p><hr /><h3>St. Catherine of Siena((1347-1380))</h3><p>SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENA Virgin and Doctor of the ChurchCo patron of Europe - Feast in Europe (1347-1380) St. Catherine, the daughter of a humble tradesman, was raised up to be the guide and guardian of the Church in one of the darkest periods of its history, the fourteenth century. As a child, prayer was her delight. She would say the Hail Mary on each step as she mounted the stairs, and was granted in reward a vision of Christ in glory. When seven years old, she made a vow of virginity, and afterwards endured bitter resentment and mistreatment for refusing to marry. Our Lord gave her his heart in exchange for her own, communicated her with his own hands, and stamped on her body the print of his wounds. At the age of fifteen, she entered the Third Order of St. Dominic, but continued to reside in her father's shop, where she united a life of active charity with the prayer of a contemplative Saint. From this obscure home, the seraphic virgin was summoned to defend the Church's cause. Armed with Papal authority, and accompanied by three confessors, she travelled through Italy, reducing rebellious cities to the obedience of the Holy See, and winning hardened souls to God. In the face of impossibility, well-nigh of the whole world, she sought out Gregory XI at Avignon, brought him back to Rome, and by her letters to the kings and queens of Europe made good the Papal cause. She was the counsellor of Pope Urban VI, and sternly rebuked the disloyal cardinals who had part in electing an antipope. Long had the holy virgin foretold the terrible schism which began ere she died. Day and night she wept and prayed for unity and peace. But the devil excited the Roman people against the Pope, so that some sought the life of Christ's Vicar. With intense earnestness did St. Catherine beg our Lord to prevent this enormous crime. In spirit, she saw the whole city full of demons tempting the people to resist and even slay the Pope. The seditious temper was subdued by Catherine's prayers; but the devils vented their malice by scourging the Saint herself, who gladly endured all for God and his Church. Her experiences of being buffeted by demons reflect those of other Saints like St. Padre Pio; and even other Christians who experienced assault by the demonic. Hence her trust and intercession may be relied upon with those who have conquered; foremost the Blessed Virgin. She passed away at Rome in 1380, age thirty-three. Her intercession for causes has been firmly established. She looks upon all who trust in her with joy. Interceeding on our behalf before God forever.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hugh of Cluny(Abbot (1024-1109))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT HUGH Abbot of Cluny (1024-1109) St. Hugh was a prince related to the sovereign house of the dukes of Burgundy, and had his education under the tuition of his pious Mother, and under the care of Hugh, Bishop of Auxerre, his great-uncle. From his infancy, he was exceedingly given to prayer and meditation, and his life was remarkably innocent and holy. One day, hearing an account of the wonderful sanctity of the monks of Cluny under St. Odilo, he was so moved that he set out that moment; and going thither, humbly begged the monastic habit. After a rigid novitiate, he made his profession in 1039, being sixteen years old. His extraordinary virtue, especially his admirable humility, obedience, charity, sweetness, prudence, and zeal, gained him the respect of the whole community; and upon the death of St. Odilo, in 1049, though only twenty-five years old, he succeeded to the government of that great abbey, which he held sixty-two years. He received to the religious profession Hugh, Duke of Burgundy, and died on the twenty-ninth of April, in 1109, aged eighty-five.He was canonized twelve years after his death by Pope Calixtus II.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Mary Magdalene of the Incarnation((1770-1824))</h3><hr /><p>Bl. Mary Magdalene of the Incarnation Foundress, Perpetual Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament (1770-1824) Caterina Sordini was born on 16 April 1770 at Grosseto, Italy, the fourth of nine children born into a deeply Catholic family. When she was 17, her father arranged for her to marry a maritime merchant. At first she was against it, but later complied with her father's wishes. The young man gave her a casket of jewels and, having adorned herself, turned to admire her reflection in the mirror but saw the image of the Crucified Christ who asked: \"Do you want to leave me for another?\" She took the question seriously; and in February 1788 visited the Franciscan Tertiary Monastery in Ischia di Castro. Caterina entered then and there, thus shocking her father who had thought it was merely a visit. She was clothed six months later, taking the name of Sr. Mary Magdalene of the Incarnation. On 19 February 1789, she fell into ecstasy and saw a vision of \"Jesus seated on a throne of grace in the Blessed Sacrament, surrounded by virgins adoring him\" and heard him telling her: \"I have chosen you to establish the work of perpetual adorers who, day and night, will offer me their humble adoration...\" Thus, she was called to become a foundress and to spend her life adoring Jesus in the Eucharist. In that turbulent period for the Church, she set an example to all. She was elected Abbess on 20 April 1802. The period of her governance was accompanied by extraordinary phenomena and an increasingly fervent spiritual life, and the abbey thrived. With the consent of her spiritual director and the local Bishop, she drafted the rules of the new Institute and set out for Rome on 31 May 1807. On 8 July that year, she and a few Sisters moved into Sts. Joachim and Anne convent near the Trevi Fountain. Under the French occupation, it was confiscated and the Napoleonic laws suppressed her Order. She was exiled to Tuscany.There, she formed a new group of Adorers. On 19 March 1814, when they could return to Rome, they settled at Sant'Anna al Quirinale. On 13 February 1818, Pope Pius VII approved the Institute dedicated to perpetual, solemn, public exposition of the Most Blessed Sacrament. Mother Mary Magdalene passed away in Rome on 29 April 1824. She was buried at Sant'Anna al Quirinale. In 1839, her remains were translated to the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena, the new generalate of the Perpetual Adorers in Rome.Pope St. John Paul II decreed her heroic virtues in 2001; and Pope Benedict XVI beatified her on May 3, 2008.</p>"
