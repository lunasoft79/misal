For he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.<br />And he had seven sons and three daughters,<br />of whom he called the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.<br />In all the land no other women were as beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.<br />After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; and he saw his children, his grandchildren, and even his great-grandchildren.<br />Then Job died, old and full of years.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>119(118),66.71.75.91.125.130.</em><p>Teach me wisdom and knowledge, <br />for in your commands I trust.<br />It is good for me that I have been afflicted, <br />that I may learn your statutes.<br />I know, O LORD, that your ordinances are just, <br />and in your faithfulness you have afflicted me.<br />According to your ordinances they still stand firm: <br />all things serve you.<br />I am your servant; give me discernment <br />that I may know your decrees.<br />The revelation of your words sheds light,<br />giving understanding to the simple.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>10,17-24.</em><p>The seventy-two disciples returned rejoicing and said to Jesus, \"Lord, even the demons are subject to us because of your name.\"<br />Jesus said, \"I have observed Satan fall like lightning from the sky.<br />Behold, I have given you the power 'to tread upon serpents' and scorpions and upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you.<br />Nevertheless, do not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.\"<br />At that very moment he rejoiced (in) the holy Spirit and said, \"I give you praise, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have revealed them to the childlike. Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.<br />All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal him.\"<br />Turning to the disciples in private he said, \"Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.<br />For I say to you, many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, but did not see it, and to hear what you hear, but did not hear it.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Therese of Lisieux(Virgin & Doctor of the Church (1873-1897) - Memorial)</h3><p>Saint Therese of LisieuxVirgin and Doctor of the Church(1873-1897) Thérèse Martin was born at Alençon, France on 2 January 1873. Two days later, she was baptized Marie Frances Thérèse at Notre Dame Church. Her parents were Louis Martin and Zélie Guérin. After the death of her mother on 28 August 1877, Thérèse and her family moved to Lisieux. Towards the end of 1879, she went to confession for the first time. On the Feast of Pentecost 1883, she received the singular grace of being healed from a serious illness through the intercession of Our Lady of Victories. Taught by the Benedictine Nuns of Lisieux and after an intense immediate preparation culminating in a vivid experience of intimate union with Christ, she received First Holy Communion on 8 May 1884. Some weeks later, on 14 June of the same year, she received the Sacrament of Confirmation, fully aware of accepting the gift of the Holy Spirit as a personal participation in the grace of Pentecost. She wished to embrace the contemplative life, as her sisters Pauline and Marie had done in the Carmel of Lisieux, but was prevented from doing so by her young age. On a visit to Italy, after having visited the House of Loreto and the holy places of the Eternal City, during an audience granted by Pope Leo XIII to the pilgrims from Lisieux on 20 November 1887, she asked the Holy Father with childlike audacity to be able to enter the Carmel at the age of fifteen. On 9 April 1888, she entered the Carmel of Lisieux. She received the habit on 10 January of the following year, and made her religious profession on 8 September 1890 on the Feast of the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In Carmel, she embraced the way of perfection outlined by the Foundress, Saint Teresa of Jesus, fulfilling with genuine fervour and fidelity the various community responsibilities entrusted to her. Her faith was tested by the sickness of her beloved father, Louis Martin, who died on 29 July 1894. Thérèse nevertheless grew in sanctity, enlightened by the Word of God and inspired by the Gospel to place love at the centre of everything. In her autobiographical manuscripts, she left us not only her recollections of childhood and adolescence, but also a portrait of her soul, the description of her most intimate experiences. She discovered the little way of spiritual childhood and taught it to the novices entrusted to her care. She considered it a special gift to receive the charge of accompanying two \"missionary brothers\" with prayer and sacrifice. Seized by the love of Christ, her only Spouse, she penetrated ever more deeply into the mystery of the Church and became increasingly aware of her apostolic and missionary vocation to draw everyone in her path. On 9 June 1895, on the Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity, she offered herself as a sacrificial victim to the merciful Love of God. At this time, she wrote her first autobiographical manuscript, which she presented to Mother Agnes for her birthday on 21 January 1896. Several months later, on 3 April, in the night between Holy Thursday and Good Friday, she suffered a haemoptysis, the first sign of the illness which would lead to her death. She welcomed this event as a mysterious visitation of the Divine Spouse. From this point forward, she entered a trial of faith which would last until her death. In September, she completed Manuscript B, which gave striking evidence of her spiritual maturity, particularly the discovery of her vocation in the heart of the Church. While her health declined and the time of trial continued, she began work in the month of June on Manuscript C, dedicated to Mother Marie de Gonzague. New graces led her to higher perfection and she discovered fresh insights for the diffusion of her message in the Church, for the benefit of souls who would follow her way. She was transferred to the infirmary on 8 July. Her sisters and other religious women collected her sayings. Meanwhile, her sufferings and trials intensified. She accepted them with patience up to the moment of her death in the afternoon of 30 September 1897. \"I am not dying, I am entering life,\" she wrote to her missionary spiritual brother, Father M. Bellier. Her final words, \"My God..., I love you!\", seal a life which was extinguished on earth at the age of twenty-four. Thus began, as was her desire, a new phase of apostolic presence on behalf of souls in the Communion of Saints, in order to shower a rain of roses upon the world. She was canonized by Pope Pius XI on 17 May 1925. The same Pope proclaimed her Universal Patron of the Missions, alongside Saint Francis Xavier, on 14 December 1927. Her teaching and example of holiness has been received with great enthusiasm by all sectors of the faithful during this century, as well as by people outside the Catholic Church and outside Christianity. On the occasion of the centenary of her death, many Episcopal Conferences have asked the Pope to declare her a Doctor of the Church, in view of the soundness of her spiritual wisdom inspired by the Gospel, the originality of her theological intuitions filled with sublime teaching, and the universal acceptance of her spiritual message, which has been welcomed throughout the world and spread by the translation of her works into over fifty languages. Mindful of these requests, Pope John Paul II asked the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which has competence in this area, in consultation with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith with regard to her teaching, to study the suitability of proclaiming her a Doctor of the Church. On 24 August, at the close of the Eucharistic Celebration at the Twelfth World Youth Day in Paris, in the presence of hundreds of bishops and before an immense crowd of young people from the whole world, Pope John Paul II announced his intention to proclaim Thérèse of the Child Jesus and of the Holy Face a Doctor of the Universal Church on World Mission Sunday, 19 October 1997.</p>"

Destruction and violence are before me; there is strife, and clamorous discord.<br />Then the LORD answered me and said: Write down the vision Clearly upon the tablets, so that one can read it readily.<br />For the vision still has its time, presses on to fulfillment, and will not disappoint; If it delays, wait for it, it will surely come, it will not be late.<br />The rash man has no integrity; but the just man, because of his faith, shall live.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>95(94),1-2.6-7.8-9.</em><p>Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD; <br />let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.<br />Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; <br />let us joyfully sing psalms to him.<br />Come, let us bow down in worship; <br />let us kneel before the LORD who made us.<br />For he is our God, <br />and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides.<br />Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br />“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah, <br />as in the day of Massah in the desert,<br />Where your fathers tempted me; <br />they tested me though they had seen my works.”  </p><h3>Second Letter to Timothy</h3><em>1,6-8.13-14.</em><p>Beloved: I remind you to stir into flame the gift of God that you have through the imposition of my hands.<br />For God did not give us a spirit of cowardice but rather of power and love and self-control.<br />So do not be ashamed of your testimony to our Lord, nor of me, a prisoner for his sake; but bear your share of hardship for the gospel with the strength that comes from God.<br />Take as your norm the sound words that you heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.<br />Guard this rich trust with the help of the holy Spirit that dwells within us.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>17,5-10.</em><p>The apostles said to the Lord, \"Increase our faith.\"<br />The Lord replied, \"If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you would say to (this) mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.<br />Who among you would say to your servant who has just come in from plowing or tending sheep in the field, 'Come here immediately and take your place at table'?<br />Would he not rather say to him, 'Prepare something for me to eat.

But there are some who are disturbing you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.<br />But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach (to you) a gospel other than the one that we preached to you, let that one be accursed!<br />As we have said before, and now I say again, if anyone preaches to you a gospel other than the one that you received, let that one be accursed!<br />Am I now currying favor with human beings or God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.<br />Now I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin.<br />For I did not receive it from a human being, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>111(110),1-2.7-8.9.10c.</em><p>I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart <br />in the company and assembly of the just.<br />Great are the works of the LORD, <br />exquisite in all their delights.<br />The works of his hands are faithful and just; <br />sure are all his precepts,<br />Reliable forever and ever, <br />wrought in truth and equity.<br />He has sent deliverance to his people; <br />he has ratified his covenant forever; <br />holy and awesome is his name.<br />His praise endures forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>10,25-37.</em><p>There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test Jesus and said, \"Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\"<br />He said in reply, \"You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\"<br />He replied to him, \"You have answered correctly; do this and you will live.\"<br />But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus, \"And who is my neighbor?\"<br />Jesus replied, \"A man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.<br />A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.<br />Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.<br />But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.<br />He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn and cared for him.<br />The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, 'Take care of him. If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.'<br />Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robbers' victim?\"<br />He answered, \"The one who treated him with mercy.\" Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Mother Théodore Guérin (1798-1856)()</h3><p>SAINT MOTHER THÉODORE GUÉRIN With trust in God’s providence, St. Mother Théodore left her homeland, sailed halfway around the world, andfounded a new religious congregation. Born in Etables, France, Anne-Thérèse Guerin’s life was shattered by her father’s murder when she was fifteen. For several years, she cared for her mother and younger sister. She entered the Sisters of Providence in 1823, taking the name Sister St. Théodore. An illness during novitiate left her with lifelong fragile health, but that did not keep her from becoming an accomplished teacher. In 1840, at the invitation of the bishop of Vincennes, Sister St. Théodore and five sisters were sent to Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, to teach and care for the poor. There, she established a motherhouse and novitiate. For several months, the sisters and their hosts lived packed into a small frontier farmhouse. Only later did they learn that their French superiors wanted them to form a new religious congregation. Despite their humble resources, in July 1841, Sister St. Théodore and the sisters opened St. Mary's Academy for Young Ladies, which later became Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. Her doubts concerning the success of the institution were natural. She wrote in her journal, \"It is astonishing that this remote solitude has been chosen for a novitiate and especially for an academy. All appearances are against it.\" For more than a decade, from 1841 to 1852, this Academy was the only Catholic boarding school for girls in Indiana. Sister St. Théodore and her community persevered despite fires, crop failures, prejudice against Catholic women religious, misunderstandings and separation from their original religious congregation. She once told her sisters, “Have confidence in the Providence that so far has never failed us. The way is not yet clear. Grope along slowly. Do not press matters; be patient, be trustful.” Another time, she asked, “With Jesus, what shall we have to fear?” Sister St. Théodoreproved to be a skilled businesswoman and leader as well as a beloved general superior. St. Mother Théodore is buried in the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana. She is known for her advancement of education and founding numerous parish schools. She was beatified by Pope Saint John Paul II in October 1998 and canonized a saint on October 15, 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gerard of Brogne(Abbot († 959))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GERARD OF BROGNEAbbot( 959) Saint Gerard was of a noble family of the county of Namur, France. His engaging sweetness of temper and strong inclination to piety and devotion belied an active will and intellect conformed to the Divine. On an important mission to the Royal Court, he was struck by the fervor of the monks of St. Denis at Paris, and earnestly desired to consecrate himself to God with them. Returning home, he settled his temporal affairs and went back with great joy to St. Denis'. St. Gerard lived ten years with great fervor in this monastery when he returned to Brogne in 931 and reformed the clergy. He helped appoint holy monks who possessed the Holy Spirit. St. Gerard built himself a cell near the church; and contemplated God until successfully reforming many other monasteries. After spending another twenty years in zealous labors, he shut himself up in his cell to prepare for death. He was called by Jesus to heaven on October 3, 959.</p>"

Tell her to help me.\"<br />The Lord said to her in reply, \"Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things.<br />There is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part and it will not be taken from her.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226)()</h3><p>SAINT FRANCIS OF ASSISI (1182-1226)St. Francis of Assisi founded the Franciscans and is one of the most popular mystics. He left home, riches and family to be with the poor and marginalized. In all creation, he saw the image of God. By imitating Jesus Christ, he became the founder of evangelical poverty. He was so dead to self, and his mind fixed in God, that he received the stigmata. St. Francis' father was a cloth merchant. Zealous and thundering, St. Francis became a soldier. However, a vision of God turned him from a spirited youth without military potential into a man of prayer, recollection and profound humility. Praying with devotion to discern the will of God, he began to imitate the poor in order to minister to them. \"He took on our infirmities, and carried our diseases\" (Is. 53:4). \"One who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin\" (Heb. 4:15).In what appeared to be an act of madness, St. Francis took his father's cloth and sold it to restore the Church of San Damiano. His father took him to court; and in full view of the Bishop, he stripped off his garments, gave them to his father and declared he had no posessions. Literally imitating Jesus, St. Francis preached to the poor; going barefoot, and \"(taking) no gold, nor silver, nor money in his belt...\" (Mt. 10:9). When he and his brethren tried founding a new religious order, they encountered opposition from Pope Innocent III. The pope consented only after seeing St. Francis in a vision. In the vision, St. Francis was holding up the Church of San Giovanni in Laterano. Satan retaliated by sending a band of robbers to beat St. Francis; the latter only gave small jumps and yelps of joy, \"because indignity was his only dignity\" (Chesterton). The poverty and preaching of the Franciscans galvanized the Western world. Noblemen, zealous for the House of the Lord, raised altars where churches lay abandoned. One even donated an entire mountain to St. Francis. The order of Poor Clares and Franciscan lay movements stemmed from St. Francis' apostolate. His rule includes material poverty and self-denial to be with Christ. In 1224, while preparing for the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, St. Francis prayed how to best please God. In that moment, St. Francis' biographer and those with him say: a vision filled the world, and a crucified Seraph came down from heaven; who had 2 wings above his head, 2 outstretched in flight, and 2 covering his body; whose face was beautiful beyond description, and who smiled gently upon St. Francis. From the vision, St. Francis learned that he would conform to Christ by heart instead of physical martyrdom. The brilliance of that vision never left St. Francis; and neither did the ensuing stigmata, which lasted for the rest of his life. When St. Francis received Christ's stigmata, he was in bodily pain and near the end of his life. He sought to give more when he had none. Let us not create needs for ourselves, be humbled by others and bear it for Christ, reject hedonism and the near occasions of sin, and conform our will and intellect to the Divine.</p>"

Francis Xavier Seelos()</h3><p>Bl. Francis Xavier SeelosPriest(1819-1867) Bl. Francis was born in Füssen, Bavaria, Germany on January 11, 1819. He was one of 12 children born to Mang and Frances Schwarzenbach Seelos, and was baptized the same day in the parish church. Having expressed a desire for the priesthood since childhood, he studied philosophy and theology in Munich. In Munich, Seelos was touched by letters published in the Catholic newspaper Sion, which described the lack of spiritual care for German-speaking immigrants. After visiting the Redemptorists in Altötting, Seelos decided to enter the Congregation, asking to be allowed to work as a missionary in the United States. On December 22, 1844, he was ordained a priest in Baltimore, Maryland. He was assigned for six years to St. Philomena’s Parish in Pittsburgh as an assistant to St. John Neumann. Regarding their relationship, Seelos said, \"He has introduced me to the active life\"; and \"has guided me as a spiritual director and confessor.\" Along with several years of parish ministry in Maryland, he had responsibility for training Redemptorist students. His availability and innate kindness in understanding and responding to the needs of the faithful quickly made him well known as an expert confessor and spiritual director. People would seek him out from neighboring towns. His confessional was open to all: \"I hear confessions in German, English, French, of Whites and of Blacks.\" He practiced a simple lifestyle and a simple manner of expressing himself. The themes of his preaching, rich in Biblical content, were always understood by his varied listeners. Father Seelos is described as a man with a constant smile and a generous heart, especially towards the marginalized. For several years, he preached in English and German throughout the Midwest and in the Middle Atlantic states. Assigned to St. Mary of the Assumption Church community in New Orleans, he served his Redemptorist confreres and parishioners with great zeal. In 1867, he passed away from yellow fever, having contracted that disease while visiting the sick.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mary Faustina Kowalska(Virgin (1905-1938))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARY FAUSTINA KOWALSKA Virgin (1905-1938) Sister Mary Faustina, an apostle of the Divine Mercy, belongs today to the group of the most popular and well-known saints of the Church. Through her, the Lord Jesus communicates to the world the great message of God's mercy and reveals the pattern of Christian perfection based on trust in God and on the attitude of mercy toward one's neighbors. She was born on August 25, 1905, in Głogowiec, Poland, to a poor and religious farming family, the third of ten children. She was baptized with the name Helena in the parish Church of Świnice Warckich. From a very tender age, she stood out for her love of prayer, work, obedience, and also her sensitivity to the poor. At the age of nine, she made her first Holy Communion: living this moment very profoundly in her awareness of the presence of the Divine Guest within her soul. She attended school for three years. At the age of sixteen, she left home and went to work as a housekeeper in Aleksandrów, Łodzi i Ostrówek, to find the means of supporting herself and of helping her parents. At the age of seven, she had already felt the first stirrings of a religious vocation. After finishing school, she wanted to enter the convent, but her parents disagreed. Called during a vision of the Suffering Christ, on August 1, 1925, she entered the Congregation of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy and took the name Sister Mary Faustina. She lived in the Congregation for thirteen years and lived in several religious houses. She spent time at Kraków, Płock and Vilnius, where she worked as a cook, gardener and porter. Externally, nothing revealed her rich, mystical interior life. She zealously performed her tasks and faithfully observed the rule of religious life. She was recollected and at the same time very natural, serene and full of kindness and disinterested love for her neighbor. Although her life was apparently insignificant, she hid within herself an extraordinary union with God. She contemplated the mystery of God's Mercy in the Word of God as well as in the everyday activities of her life, which formed the basis of her spirituality. The process of contemplating and getting to know the mystery of God's mercy helped develop her attitude of child-like trust in God as well as mercy toward the neighbors. \"O my Jesus, each of Your saints reflects one of Your virtues; I desire to reflect Your compassionate heart, full of mercy; I want to glorify it. Let Your mercy, O Jesus, be impressed upon my heart and soul like a seal, and this will be my badge in this and the future life\" (Diary 1242). Sr. Faustina was a faithful daughter of the Church, which she loved like a Mother and the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ. Conscious of her role in the Church, she cooperated with God's mercy in the task of saving lost souls. At the specific request of the Lord, and following His example, she sacrificed her own life for this very goal. In her spiritual life, she also distinguished herself with a love of the Eucharist and a deep devotion to the Mother of Mercy. The years she had spent at the convent were filled with extraordinary gifts, including revelations, visions, hidden stigmata, participation in the Passion of the Lord, the gift of bilocation, the reading of human souls, the gift of prophecy, and the rare gift of mystical engagement and marriage. The living relationship with God, the Blessed Mother, the Angels, the Saints, the souls in Purgatory - with the entire supernatural world - was as equally real for her as the world she perceived with her senses. In spite of being so richly endowed with extraordinary graces, Sr. Mary Faustina knew that they do not in fact constitute sanctity. In her Diary, she wrote: \"Neither graces, nor revelations, nor raptures, nor gifts granted to a soul make it perfect, but rather the intimate union of the soul with God. These gifts are merely ornaments of the soul, but constitute neither its essence nor its perfection. My sanctity and perfection consist in the close union of my will with the will of God\" (Diary 1107). The Lord Jesus chose Sr. Mary Faustina as the Apostle and \"Secretary\" of His Mercy, so that she could tell the world about His great message. \"In the Old Covenant (He said to her), I sent prophets wielding thunderbolts to My people. Today, I am sending you with My mercy to the people of the whole world. I do not want to punish aching mankind, but I desire to heal it, pressing it to My Merciful Heart\" (Diary 1588). The mission of Sister Mary Faustina consists of 3 tasks:- Reminding the world of the truth of our faith revealed in the Holy Scripture about the merciful love of God toward every human being.- Entreating God's mercy for the whole world and particularly for sinners, among others through the practice of new forms of devotion to the Divine Mercy presented by the Lord Jesus, such as: the veneration of the image of the Divine Mercy with the inscription: Jesus, I Trust in You, the feast of the Divine Mercy celebrated on the first Sunday after Easter, chaplet to the Divine Mercy and prayer at the Hour of Mercy (3 p.m.). The Lord Jesus attached great promises to the above forms of devotion, provided one entrusted one's life to God and practiced active love of one's neighbor.- The third task in her mission consists in initiating the apostolic movement of the Divine Mercy, which undertakes the task of proclaiming and entreating God's mercy for the world and strives for Christian perfection. St. Faustina's precepts require the faithful to display an attitude of child-like trust in God, which expresses itself in fulfilling His will as well as in the attitude of mercy toward one's neighbors. Today, this movement within the Church involves millions of people throughout the world; it comprises religious congregations, lay institutes, religious, brotherhoods, associations, various communities of apostles of the Divine Mercy, as well as individual people who take up the tasks which the Lord Jesus communicated to them. The mission of the Blessed Sr. Mary Faustina was recorded in her diary, which she kept at the specific request of the Lord Jesus and her confessors. In it, she recorded faithfully all of the Lord's wishes, and also described the encounters between Him and her soul. The Lord said to her, \"Your task is to write down everything that I make known to you about My mercy, for the benefit of those who, by reading these things, will be comforted in their souls and will have the courage to approach Me\" (Diary 1693). In an extraordinary way, Sr. Mary Faustina's work sheds light on the mystery of the Divine Mercy. It delights not only the simple and uneducated, but also scholars who look upon it as an additional source of theological research. The Diary has been translated into many languages, among others, English, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Arabic, Russian, Hungarian, Czech and Slovak. Sister Mary Faustina, consumed by tuberculosis and sufferings which she accepted as a voluntary sacrifice for sinners, died in Krakow at the age of just thirty three on October 5, 1938, with a reputation for spiritual maturity and a mystical union with God. The reputation of the holiness of her life grew as did the cult to the Divine Mercy and the graces obtained from God through her intercession. In the years 1965-67, the investigative process into her life and heroic virtues was undertaken in Kraków; and in 1968, the Beatification Process was initiated in Rome. The Beatification was completed on December 1992. On April 18, 1993, St. John Paul II raised St. Faustina to the glory of the altars; canonizing her on April 4, 2000. Her resting place is at the Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy in Kraków-Łagiewniki.</p><hr /><h3>St. Placid(Martyr (6th century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT PLACID Martyr(6th century) St. Placid was born in Rome in the year 515 to a patrician family. At the age of seven, his father brought him to the monastery of Subiaco. At thirteen years of age, he followed St. Benedict to the new foundation at Monte Casino, where he grew up in the practice of piety and innocence of life. He had scarcely turned twenty-one when he was selected to establish a monastery on Sicilian estates that his father had given to St. Benedict. He spent four years building the monastery, and a fifth had not elapsed when an inroad of barbarians burned everything to the ground and put him and thirty monks to a lingering death, along with his two brothers, Eutychius and Victorinus, and his holy sister Flavia, who had come to visit. The monastery was rebuilt with St. Placid as its patron. \"Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his love endures forever\" (Ps. 107 :1). We will meet St. Placid and his family one day in the Realms of Holy Light.</p>"

He was endowed with rare natural gifts, which he cultivated at Paris. He became canon of Cologne, and then of Rheims, where he directed theological studies. When the bishop passed away, the see fell into evil hands; and St. Bruno retired with a few friends into the country. There, he resolved to forsake the world, and live a life of prayer, penance and mortification. With six companions, he applied to Hugh, Bishop of Grenoble, who led them into a wild solitude called the Chartreuse. In the wilderness, they lived in poverty, self-denial, and silence, each apart in his own cell, meeting only for the worship of God, and employing themselves in copying books. From the name of the place, the Order of St. Bruno was called the Carthusians. Six years later, Urban II called St. Bruno to Rome to avail of his guidance. St. Bruno tried to live there as he had in the desert, but the echoes of the great city disturbed his solitude. After refusing high dignities, he wrung from the Pope permission to resume his monastic life in Calabria. He lived there in humility and peace; passing away in 1101 to be with Jesus and the Saints.</p>"

He was from the same family as St. Vincent Ferrer. In 1545, after several trials, he was ordained a Dominican priest. At the age of twenty-five, he was appointed master of novices; and trained many outstanding disciples. When plague broke out in Valencia, he devoted himself to caring for the sick and dying. He also helped bury the dead. In 1562, he obtained leave to embark for the American mission; and there converted multitudes. He was favored with the gift of miracles, and while preaching in his native Spanish, was understood in various languages. After seven years, he returned to Spain, advocating and pressuring for the dignity and rights of Native Americans. Through his influence, the native populations were spared further decimation and hardship, resulting in changes to Spanish policies and sparing lands as far away as the Philippines.

A man ahead of his time, he opened opportunities for secular and lay people to participate in Apostolic Tradition. St. John encountered opposition, but ultimately succeeded in establishing communities that express the Deposit of Faith. After his ordination, St. John propagated devotion to the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin Mary. He communicated the deposit of faith with the help of lay movements from ordinary people. At the time, his approach was daring and original. Although experiencing setbacks from pessimistic and hesitant ecclesial authorities, St. John overcame these difficulties and founded the Clerks Regular of the Mother of God. The order trains missionary priests to this day. St. John passed away after contracting the flu during a plague outbreak in Rome. He was administering to patients and risking his life to help them when he contracted and succumbed to the illness. He was canonized in 1938. His relics are enshrined in the Santa Maria Church, Portico, Rome.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. John Henry Newman((† 1890))</h3><hr /><p>Blessed John Henry Newman Priest, founder of a religious community, theologian (1801-1890) This day that has brought us together here in Birmingham is a most auspicious one. In the first place, it is the Lord's Day, Sunday, the day when our Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead and changed the course of human history for ever, offering new life and hope to all who live in darkness and in the shadow of death. (...)Yet there is another, more joyful reason why this is an auspicious day for Great Britain, for the Midlands, for Birmingham. It is the day that sees Cardinal John Henry Newman formally raised to the altars and declared Blessed.(...) England has a long tradition of martyr saints, whose courageous witness has sustained and inspired the Catholic community here for centuries. Yet it is right and fitting that we should recognize today the holiness of a confessor, a son of this nation who, while not called to shed his blood for the Lord, nevertheless bore eloquent witness to him in the course of a long life devoted to the priestly ministry, and especially to preaching, teaching, and writing. He is worthy to take his place in a long line of saints and scholars from these islands, Saint Bede, Saint Hilda, Saint Aelred, Blessed Duns Scotus, to name but a few. In Blessed John Henry, that tradition of gentle scholarship, deep human wisdom and profound love for the Lord has borne rich fruit, as a sign of the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit deep within the heart of God's people, bringing forth abundant gifts of holiness. Cardinal Newman's motto, Cor ad cor loquitur, or \"Heart speaks unto heart\", gives us an insight into his understanding of the Christian life as a call to holiness, experienced as the profound desire of the human heart to enter into intimate communion with the Heart of God. He reminds us that faithfulness to prayer gradually transforms us into the divine likeness. As he wrote in one of his many fine sermons, \"a habit of prayer, the practice of turning to God and the unseen world in every season, in every place, in every emergency - prayer, I say, has what may be called a natural effect in spiritualizing and elevating the soul. A man is no longer what he was before; gradually ... he has imbibed a new set of ideas, and become imbued with fresh principles\" (Parochial and Plain Sermons, iv, 230-231). Today's Gospel tells us that no one can be the servant of two masters (cf. Lk 16:13), and Blessed John Henry's teaching on prayer explains how the faithful Christian is definitively taken into the service of the one true Master, who alone has a claim to our unconditional devotion (cf. Mt 23:10). Newman helps us to understand what this means for our daily lives: he tells us that our divine Master has assigned a specific task to each one of us, a \"definite service\", committed uniquely to every single person: \"I have my mission\", he wrote, \"I am a link in a chain, a bond of connection between persons. He has not created me for naught. I shall do good, I shall do his work; I shall be an angel of peace, a preacher of truth in my own place ... if I do but keep his commandments and serve him in my calling\" (Meditations and Devotions, 301-2). The definite service to which Blessed John Henry was called involved applying his keen intellect and his prolific pen to many of the most pressing \"subjects of the day\". His insights into the relationship between faith and reason, into the vital place of revealed religion in civilized society, and into the need for a broadly-based and wide-ranging approach to education were not only of profound importance for Victorian England, but continue today to inspire and enlighten many all over the world. I would like to pay particular tribute to his vision for education, which has done so much to shape the ethos that is the driving force behind Catholic schools and colleges today. Firmly opposed to any reductive or utilitarian approach, he sought to achieve an educational environment in which intellectual training, moral discipline and religious commitment would come together. The project to found a Catholic University in Ireland provided him with an opportunity to develop his ideas on the subject, and the collection of discourses that he published as The Idea of a University holds up an ideal from which all those engaged in academic formation can continue to learn. And indeed, what better goal could teachers of religion set themselves than Blessed John Henry's famous appeal for an intelligent, well-instructed laity: \"I want a laity, not arrogant, not rash in speech, not disputatious, but men who know their religion, who enter into it, who know just where they stand, who know what they hold and what they do not, who know their creed so well that they can give an account of it, who know so much of history that they can defend it\" (The Present Position of Catholics in England, ix, 390). On this day when the author of those words is raised to the altars, I pray that, through his intercession and example, all who are engaged in the task of teaching and catechesis will be inspired to greater effort by the vision he so clearly sets before us. While it is John Henry Newman's intellectual legacy that has understandably received most attention in the vast literature devoted to his life and work, I prefer on this occasion to conclude with a brief reflection on his life as a priest, a pastor of souls. The warmth and humanity underlying his appreciation of the pastoral ministry is beautifully expressed in another of his famous sermons: \"Had Angels been your priests, my brethren, they could not have condoled with you, sympathized with you, have had compassion on you, felt tenderly for you, and made allowances for you, as we can; they could not have been your patterns and guides, and have led you on from your old selves into a new life, as they can who come from the midst of you\" (\"Men, not Angels: the Priests of the Gospel\", Discourses to Mixed Congregations, 3). He lived out that profoundly human vision of priestly ministry in his devoted care for the people of Birmingham during the years that he spent at the Oratory he founded, visiting the sick and the poor, comforting the bereaved, caring for those in prison. No wonder that on his death so many thousands of people lined the local streets as his body was taken to its place of burial not half a mile from here. One hundred and twenty years later, great crowds have assembled once again to rejoice in the Church's solemn recognition of the outstanding holiness of this much-loved father of souls. What better way to express the joy of this moment than by turning to our heavenly Father in heartfelt thanksgiving, praying in the words that Blessed John Henry Newman placed on the lips of the choirs of angels in heaven:Praise to the Holiest in the height And in the depth be praise; In all his words most wonderful, Most sure in all his ways! (The Dream of Gerontius).(Homily of his holiness Benedict XVI - Mass with the beatification of venerable cardinal John Henry Newman - Birmingham - Sunday, 19 September 2010)</p>"

It was some years before he could follow God's calling. At length, he entered the Society of Jesus to cut himself off from any chance of dignity or preferment. But his Order chose him to be its head. When the Ottoman Empire threatened Christendom, St. Pius V sent his nephew to gather Christian princes into a league for its defense. The holy Pope chose Francis to accompany him, and although spread too thin, the Saint obeyed at once.

The disease was then incurable, and St. Damien contracted it after more than a decade of service. In laying down his life, St. Damien became alter Christus, \"another Christ.\" Born in Tremelo, Belgium, on January 3, 1840, St. Damien was christened Joseph. He joined the Sacred Hearts Fathers and received the name Damien when he was twenty years old. In 1864, Fr. Damien was sent to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he was ordained. For the next nine years, he worked in missions on the big island, Hawaii. In 1873, St. Damien volunteered to permanently live and work on the leper colony in Molokai. He cared for all victims; especially children segregated on the colony. In 1885, Fr. Damien announced he was a leper. He continued building hospitals, clinics, churches and some six hundred coffins. He died on April 15 in Molokai. He was declared venerable in 1977; and beatified on June 4, 1995, by Pope St. John Paul II. He was canonized on October 11, 2009, in Rome; in the presence of King Albert II of the Belgians and Queen Paola as well as the Belgian Prime Minister and several cabinet ministers. \"Not without fear and loathing,\" Pope Benedict said, \"Fr. Damian made the choice to go on the island of Molokai in the service of lepers ... The servant of the Word became a suffering servant, leper with the lepers during the last four years of his life. ... To follow Christ, Father Damian not only left his homeland, but also staked his health. So he, as the word of Jesus in today's Gospel tells us, received eternal life.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Tarachus and his Companions(Martyrs († 304))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT TARACHUS and his Companions Martyrs ( 304) In 304 A.D., Tarachus, Probus and Andronicus were arrested and martyred. From the beginning, Christians were persecuted by secular persons and institutions. Arrested during the Roman persecutions, these Saints laid down their lives rather than renounce their faith in Christ. Sts. Tarachus and Companions were arrested at Pompeiopolis. They were imprisoned in Tharsis and tortured. A second examination in Mopsuestia was more horrible. A third examination at Anazarbis failed to shake their Faith. Frustrated, the Governor ordered Tarachus and his companions thrown to hungry lions in the aphitheatre. When the lions were set loose, they crouched at Tarachus' feet and nursed his wounds. Witnessing this, the judge ordered Sts. Tarachus and Companions killed by gladiators.</p><hr /><h3>St. Firminus()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

St. Wilfrid was born about 634 A.D. and trained by Celtic monks at Lindisfarne, in the rites and usages of the British Church. As a boy, Wilfrid longed for perfect conformity with the Holy See, and at first chance set off for Rome. On his return, St. Wilfrid founded a monastery at Ripon under the rule of St. Benedict. In 664 A.D., St. Wilfrid was elected Bishop of Lindisfarne, and five years later transferred to the see of York. He had to combat the passions of wicked kings, the cowardice of worldly prelates, and the errors of holy men. He was twice exiled and once imprisoned; yet he persevered. He emerged \"from the dark and desolate valley to the sunlit path of justice.\" He was a reformist in the sense of correcting iniquities within his Order. He also reformed the Church system which was nationalistic rather than Universal. He was called by Christ to eternal reward onOctober 12, 709.</p>"

When he saw a servant robbing his treasury, he let the servant escape, undoubtedly correcting the latter in private. He would stand at his palace-gate to speak with beggars and lepers. He also healed many diseases, often spiritual, by acting prudently. In years prior, long wars had dragged down the economy, but St. Edward's laws enacted changes that reformed institutions.

During Emperor Severus' persecution, St. Callistus was forced to take shelter in the poor and populous quarters of the city. In spite of troubles and caring for the Church, St. Callistus made diligent search for the body of Calipodius, one of his clergy, who had suffered martyrdom by being drowned in the Tiber. When he found the body, St. Callistus was grateful, and buried his friend with hymns of praise. St. Callistus was martyred about 222 A.D.

But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Marguerite d'Youville()</h3><p>MARGUERITE d'YOUVILLE, the first native Canadian to be canonized, was born on October 15, 1701, at Varennes, Quebec. She was the eldest child of Christophe Dufrost de Lajemmerais and Marie-Renée Gaultier. Her father passed away when she was seven years old, leaving his family of six in great poverty. It was only through the influence of her great grandfather, Pierre Boucher, that she was able to study for two years at the Ursulines in Quebec. Upon her return, she became an invaluable support to her mother and undertook the education of her brothers and sisters.Marguerite married François d'Youville in 1722; and the young couple made their home with his mother who made life miserable for her daughter-in-law. Marguerite soon came to realize that her husband had no interest in making a home life. His frequent absences and illegal liquor trading with the Indians caused her great suffering. She was pregnant with her sixth child when François became seriously ill. She faithfully cared for him until his death in 1730. By age 29, she had experienced desperate poverty and suffered the loss of her father and husband. Four of her six children had died in infancy.In all these suffering, Marguerite grew in her belief of God's presence in her life and of his tender love for every human person. She, in turn, wanted to make known his compassionate love to all. She undertook many charitable works with complete trust in God, who she loved as a Father. She provided for the education of her two sons, who later became priests, and she welcomed a blind woman into her home. Marguerite was soon joined by three young women who shared her love and concern for the poor. On December 31, 1737, they consecrated themselves to God and promised to serve him in the person of the poor. Marguerite, without even realizing it, had become the foundress of the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, \"Grey Nuns.\"Marguerite always fought for the rights of the poor and broke with the social conventions of her day. It was a daring move that made her the object of ridicule and taunts by her own relatives and neighbors. She persevered in caring for the poor despite many obstacles. She was in weakened health and mourning the death of one of her companions when a fire destroyed their home. This only served to deepen her commitment to the poor. On February 2, 1745, she and her two early companions pledged themselves to put everything in common in order to help a greater number of persons in need. Two years later, this \"mother of the poor\" as she was called, was asked to become director of the Charon Brothers Hospital in Montreal, which was falling into ruin. She and her sisters rebuilt the hospital and cared for those in greatest need. With the help of her sisters and their lay collaborators, Marguerite laid the foundation for service to the poor and destitute.In 1765, a fire destroyed the hospital, but nothing could destroy Marguerite's faith and courage. She asked her sisters and the poor who lived at the hospital to recognize the hand of God in this disaster and to offer him praise. At the age of 64, she undertook the reconstruction of this shelter for those in need. Totally exhausted from a lifetime of self-giving, Marguerite died on December 23, 1771, and will always be remembered as a loving mother who served Jesus Christ in the poor.Marguerite was one woman, but this daughter of the Church had a vision of caring for the poor that has spread far and wide. Her sisters have served on almost every continent. Today, her mission is courageously carried on in a spirit of hope by the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, \"Grey Nuns,\" and their sister communities: the Sisters of Charity of St. Hyacinthe, the Sisters of Charity at Ottawa, the Sisters of Charity of Quebec, the Grey Nuns of the Sacred Heart (Philadelphia) and the Grey Sisters of the Immaculate Conception (Pembroke).</p><hr /><h3>St. Margaret Mary Alacoque(Virgin (1647-1690))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARGARET MARY ALACOQUE Virgin (1647-1690) St. Margaret of the Visitation Order was a mystic and Apostle of the Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She was born in Lhautecour, France, on July 22, 1647. St. Margaret's parents, Claude Alacoque and Philiberte Lamyn, were distinguished for their virtues and modesty. From childhood, Margaret showed intense love for the Blessed Sacrament. She also preferred silence and prayer to passion-infused amusement. After her first communion at the age of nine, she practiced severe corporal mortifications in secret until paralysis confined her to bed for four years. After recuperating, she made a vow to the Blessed Virgin to consecrate herself to religious life, and was restored immediately to perfect health. The death of her father and the injustice of a relative plunged her family into poverty, after which Margaret found greater consolation in the Blessed Sacrament. Around this time, Jesus made her sensible of His presence and protection. When Margaret was seventeen, the family property was recovered. At this, her mother persuaded her to establish herself, and the filial tenderness made Margaret believe her childhood vow was not binding. One night, after returning from a ball, she had a vision of Christ during His scourging. On 25 May, 1671, she entered the Visitation Convent at Paray, and in November, 1672, pronounced her final vows. She had a delicate constitution, but was gifted with intelligence and good judgment. To mortify her senses, she selected otherwise hard and repugnant jobs. Here, Our Lordconfided to the mission to establish devotion to His Sacred Heart. These extraordinary occurrences drew the attention and critque of her community, who treated her as a visionary. In a turn of events, because of St. Margaret's grace and charity, her mission was recognized by everyone, including her most bitter opponents. In the first revelation, Jesus said he ardently desires to be loved by men; to manifest His Heart with all Its treasures of love and mercy, sanctification and salvation. In the visions, Jesus called St. Margaret \"the Beloved Disciple of the Sacred Heart.\"In her final illness, St. Margaret repeated Jesus' name. She passed away into Our Savior's arms at Paray-le-Monial on October 17, 1690.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hedwig(Religious (1174-1243))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT HEDWIG Religious (1174-1243) St. Hedwig, wife of Henry, Duke of Silesia, and mother of their six children, led a richly-interior, outwardly simple, occasionally austere life. Her state in Court was alight - brilliant with the light of Jesus Christ. Devotion to the Blessed Sacrament was her Joy. She felt privileged to supply the bread and wine for the Sacred Mysteries. She attended Mass at least once every morning. After her husband's death, St. Hedwig retired to the Cistercian convent of Trebnitz. There, she lived obediently to the abbess of the monastery, Gertrude, her daughter. St. Hedwig grew in holiness until God called her to paradise in 1242.</p>"

During Domitian's persecution, St. Ignatius obtained peace for his flock through fasting and prayer. He shared in the passion of Christ alongside the Blessed Virgin Mary, proving himself a true disciple. In 107 A.D., Emperor Trajan came to Antioch and forced the Christians to choose between apostasy and death. When the emperor questioned St. Ignatius about the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, St. Ignatius explained that Jesus dwelt in his heart through the affections, in his mind through the intellect, and in his soul through grace. St. Ignatius' fearless and heroic testament moved the Roman authority to issue the death penalty. Condemned to death, St. Ignatius was brought to Rome and thrown to lions in the amphitheatre. The lions tore St. Ignatius apart and ate his whole body. The bones and pieces remaining were reverently collected and interred at Antioch. In 637, they were transferred to the Church of St. Clement in Rome. After St. Ignatius' death, many Christians saw him in visions interceding for them before Christ.</p>"

Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is helpful to me in the ministry.<br />I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.<br />When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas, the papyrus rolls, and especially the parchments.<br />Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.<br />You too be on guard against him, for he has strongly resisted our preaching.<br />At my first defense no one appeared on my behalf, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them!<br />But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the proclamation might be completed and all the Gentiles might hear it.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>145(144),10-11.12-13ab.17-18.</em><p>Let all your works give you thanks, O LORD,<br />and let your faithful ones bless you.<br />Let them discourse of the glory of your Kingdom <br />and speak of your might.<br />Making known to men your might <br />and the glorious splendor of your Kingdom.<br />Your Kingdom is a Kingdom for all ages,<br />and your dominion endures through all generations.<br />The LORD is just in all his ways <br />and holy in all his works.<br />The LORD is near to all who call upon him, <br />to all who call upon him in truth.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>10,1-9.</em><p>The Lord Jesus appointed seventy-two others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every town and place he intended to visit.<br />He said to them, \"The harvest is abundant but the laborers are few; so ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.<br />Go on your way; behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.<br />Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals; and greet no one along the way.<br />Into whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this household.'<br />If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you.<br />Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another.<br />Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you,<br />cure the sick in it and say to them, 'The kingdom of God is at hand for you.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Luke(Evangelist (1st century))</h3><p>SAINT LUKE Evangelist(Feast) St. Luke, a physician and painter at Antioch, was converted by St. Paul. He is best known as the historian of the New Testament and St. Paul's travel companion. Though not an eye-witness of our Lord's life, the Evangelist diligently gathered information from the lips of the apostles, and wrote, as he tells us, all things in order. The Acts of the Apostles were written by St. Luke as a sequel to his Gospel, bringing the history of the Church down to the first imprisonment of St. Paul at Rome. The humble historian never names himself, but the occasional use of \"we\" for \"they\" marks his presence in scenes he describes. We thus find that he sailed with St. Paul and Silas from Troas to Macedonia; stayed behind apparently for seven years at Philippi, and, lastly, shared the shipwreck and perils of the memorable voyage to Rome. Here, his own narrative ends, but from St. Paul's Epistles we learn that St. Luke was a faithful companion to the end. He was martyred in Achaia, modern-day Greece.</p><hr /><h3>St. Peter of Alcantara(Priest (1499-1562))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT PETER OF ALCANTARA Priest (1499-1562) In his youth, St. Peter left his home in Alcantara, Spain, and entered a monastery of Discalced Franciscans. He rose quickly to high posts, but his thirst for penance went unappeased. In 1539, at forty years old, he founded the first monastery of the Strict Observance. The cells of his friars were both simple and rustic. St. Peter's cell was only four and a half feet in length. He often fasted and ate once every three days. A sack-cloth and cloak were his only clothes. In the deep winter, he opened the windows of his cell and shut them again to experience some sensation of warmth. All of St. Peter's mortifications were penance for sins, that he may cling to God alone by disciplining his flesh. Among those he trained to perfection was St. Teresa. He read her soul, approved of her spirit of prayer, and encouraged her to carry out her reforms. St. Peter passed away on October 18, 1562, with a cheerful countenance. He lives forever in the presence of our Lord and the saints; listening to prayers and interceding.</p>"

During childhood, while praying in church, a heavy bench fell on his foot, but the boy took no notice of the bleeding wound, and spoke of it as \"a rose sent from God.\" A few years later, the vision of a scourge with \"love\" written on its lashes assured him that his thirst for penance would be appeased. In the hope of dying for the faith, he enlisted in a crusade against the Turks; but a voice from the Tabernacle warned him that he was to serve Christ alone, and that he should found a congregation in His honor. At the command of his bishop, St. Paul began, while a layman, to preach the Passion; and a series of crosses tried the reality of his vocation. All his first companions, save his brother, deserted him; the Sovereign Pontiff refused him an audience; and it was only after a delay of seventeen years that the Papal approbation was obtained and the first house of the Passionists was opened on Monte Argentario, the spot which Our Lady had pointed out. St. Paul chose as the badge of his Order a heart with three nails, in memory of the sufferings of Jesus, but for himself he invented a more durable sign. Moved by the same holy impulse as Blessed Henry Suso, St. Jane Frances, and other Saints, he branded on his side the Holy Name, and its characters were found there after death. His heart beat with a supernatural palpitation, which was especially fervent on Fridays. The heat radiating from his chest was so intense as to scorch his shirt in the region of his heart. Amidst all his trials, which included incessant bodily pain, St. Paul read the love of Jesus everywhere, and would cry out to the flowers and grass, \"Oh! be quiet, be quiet,\" as if seeking Jesus' presence and voice. He passed away while the Passion was being read, passing from the Cross into glory with Christ.</p><hr /><h3>St. Maria Bertilla Boscardin(Virgin (1888-1922))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARIA BERTILLA BOSCARDINVirgin (1888-1922) St. Maria was born in Veneto, Northern Italy, and christened Anna Francesca Boscardin. She lived in fear of her father: a jealous and violent drunkard. As a child, she attended school irregularly because she was needed at home and in the fields. She showed few talents and was often the brunt of jokes. In 1904, she joined the Sisters of Saint Dorothy, Daughters of the Sacred Heart, at Vicenza, taking the name, \"Maria Bertilla.\" She was then sent to Treviso to learn nursing at the municipal hospital there, which was under the direction of her order. She began working in a hospital with children suffering from diphtheria. There, the young nun seemed to find her true vocation: nursing very ill and disturbed children. Later, when the hospital was taken over by the military in World War I, Sister Maria Bertilla cared for patients amidst the threat of constant air raids and bombings. She passed away in 1922 after suffering for many years from a painful tumor. Her reputation for simplicity and devoted, caring hard work left a deep impression on those who knew her. For her heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from her intercession, St. Maria was canonized in 1961.</p><hr /><h3>St. Irene()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

While studying grammar in Alexandria, he encountered Jesus Christ. After meeting the Just and Holy One through seeking and inviting God into his heart, St. Hilarion visited St. Antony in the Arabian desert and became a solitary at fifteen years old. Monks and disciples thronged the desert where St. Hilarion lived; drawn there by his sanctity. He thus moved to another country seeking greater solitude. However, miracles of mercy often announced his presence. Even his last retreat at Cyprus was broken by a paralytic, who was cured by St. Hilarion, but then magnified the Saint and spread his fame. Alban Butler paraphrases St. Hilarion's final moments, saying, \"Go forth, my soul; why dost thou doubt? Thou hast served God nigh seventy years and dost thou fear death?\" Living selflessly, St. Hilarion beheld his true love in the moments before passing on. He had long ago died to self and lived for God.</p><hr /><h3>St. Ursula(Virgin and Martyr († 453))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT URSULA Virgin and Martyr ( 453) A number of Christian families entrusted the education of their children to pious St. Ursula, and some persons of the world had in like manner placed themselves under her direction.

She established an abode on the borders of the Rhine, not far from Cologne, where she hoped to find undisturbed repose. A horde of Huns invaded the country, and Ursula and her community were harmed and humiliated. Unwavering, the women chose death over shame. Ursula edified her Sisters, who were killedtogether in 453 A.D. St. Ursula is veneratedthroughout the Church.

He persevered during the brutal of Soviet regime and witnessed first-hand its secular materialism. He guarded the treasures of Our Lady and her foretelling of the terrible persecution of the Church. He steered heroically into an era of Christian liberation. Our intecessor forever, he is a rolemodel of courage and fidelity. Karol Józef Wojtyła was born in Wadowice (Poland) on May 18, 1920. He was the second of two children. At the age of nine, Karol made his first Holy Communion. Tragedy befell when his mother, Emilia Kaczorowska, passed away that year. Three years later, Karol’s older brother, Edmund, passed away. After receiving the Sacrament of Confirmation at eighteen, Karol graduated high school and enrolled in the Jagiellonian University at Cracow. Following the occupation by Nazi forces and the University’s closure in 1939, Karol worked in a mine to make ends meet. He also worked in the Solvay Chemical Factory to avoid deportation to Germany. In 1942, his father,Karol Wojtyła, passed away. The deaths of his beloved family members surely affected him. In 1942, Karol laid down his life by answering God's call to the priesthood. He beganattending courses in secret at the Major Seminary in Cracow, directed by Archbishop Cardinal Adam Stefan Sapieha. After the war, Karol continued his studies at Cracow's Major Seminary, which had been reopened, and then at the Faculty of Theology of the Jagiellonian University, until being ordained in Cracow on November 1, 1946. He was then sent to Rome by Cardinal Sapieha where he pursued a Doctorate in Theology (1948), with a thesis on the topic of faith in the works of St. John of the Cross. During that time, in vacation periods, he exercised his pastoral ministry among Polish immigrants in France, Belgium and Holland. In 1948, he returned to Poland as assistant priest in the parish of Niegowić, near Cracow, and then in the Church of Saint Florian in the same city. As University Chaplain until 1951, he continued to study both Philosophy and Theology. In 1953, he presented a thesis at the Catholic University of Lublin on the \"Evaluation of the Possibility of Constructing a Christian Ethic on the Ethical System of Max Scheler.\" Later, he became Professor of Moral Theology and Ethics at the Major Seminary of Cracow and at the Theological Faculty of Lublin. On July 4, 1958, he was appointedAuxiliary Bishop of Cracow and Titular Bishop of Ombi by Pope Pius XII. On September 28, he was ordained Bishop in the Cathedral of Wawel (Cracow) by Archbishop Eugeniusz Baziak. On January 13, 1964, he was nominated as Archbishop of Cracow by Pope Paul VI, who also later made him a Cardinal on June 26, 1967. Wojtyła also participated in the Second Vatican Council (1962-65), at which he made an important contribution to the preparation of the Constitution Gaudium et Spes. Preceding his Pontificate, Wojtyła would also take part in five assemblies of the Synod of Bishops. He was elected to the Papacy on October 16, 1978. On October 22nd, he began his ministry as Shepherd of the Universal Church. Pope John Paul II made 146 pastoral visits in Italy. As Pope, he visited 317 of Rome’s 332 parishes. His apostolic tripsexpressing pastoral care totaled 104. Among the primary documents he wrote are 14 Encyclicals, 15 Apostolic exhortations, 11 Apostolic Constitutions and 45 Apostolic Letters. He also authored five books: \"Crossing the Threshold of Hope\" (October 1994), \"Gift and Mystery: on the Fiftieth Anniversary of My Priesthood\" (November 1996), \"Roman Triptych: editations\" (March 2003), \"Rise, Let us be on our way!\" (May 2004), and \"Memory and Identity\" (February 2005). Pope John Paul II presided over 147 Beatifications, declaring 1,338 beatified and 51 canonizations, proclaiming a total of 482 saints. He also officiated in nine Consistories, thereby creating 231 (plus 1 \"in pectore\") Cardinals and presided at six plenary reunions of the College of Cardinals. Beginning 1978, he convoked 15 Assemblies of the Synod of Bishops: six Ordinary General Assemblies (1980, 1983, 1987, 1990; 1994 and 2001), one Extraordinary General Assembly (1985) and eight Special Assemblies (1980, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998 [2] and 1999). On May 13, 1981, Pope John Paul II was shot by a terrorist in St. Peter's Square. He felt the maternal hand of the Mother of God steer the bullet clear of his heart. Following a long recovery, he met and forgave his attacker. Grateful for the gift of new life, he intensified his pastoral work with heroic generosity. His solicitude as pastor was expressed by establishing numerous dioceses and ecclesiastical circumscriptions, as well as by the promulgation of the Codes of Canon Law for the Latin Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches. As an encouragement to the People of God, he also inaugurated moments of particular spiritual intensity such as the Year of the Redemption, the Marian Year, and the Eucharistic Year, as well as the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. He also attracted younger generations by the celebration of World Youth Days. No other pope had ever encountered as many people as John Paul II: the number of pilgrims at the Wednesday General Audiences alone (more than 1,160 audiences) came to over 17 million pilgrims, to say nothing of the special audiences and other religious services (the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000 alone saw the arrival of 8 million pilgrims), and the other millions of faithful that he met during apostolic visits in Italy or throughout the world. Numerous government officials were also received in audience: there were 38 official visits and a further 738 audiences or meetings with Heads of State, along with 246 visits with Prime Ministers. Pope John Paul II passed away in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace on Saturday, April 2, 2005 at 9:37 p.m., on the Vigil of the Sunday in Albis, also commemorated as Divine Mercy Sunday, a feast which he instituted.He was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI on May 1, 2011 and canonized by Pope Francis on April 27, 2014.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mary Salome()</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARY SALOME(1st century) St. Mary Salome was one of the Three Marys who served Christ during his earthly ministry.

Amen.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>18,9-14.</em><p>Jesus addressed this parable to those who were convinced of their own righteousness and despised everyone else.<br />\"Two people went up to the temple area to pray; one was a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.<br />The Pharisee took up his position and spoke this prayer to himself, 'O God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of humanity--greedy, dishonest, adulterous--or even like this tax collector.<br />I fast twice a week, and I pay tithes on my whole income.'<br />But the tax collector stood off at a distance and would not even raise his eyes to heaven but beat his breast and prayed, 'O God, be merciful to me a sinner.'<br />I tell you, the latter went home justified, not the former; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. John of Capistrano(Priest (1386-1456))</h3><p>Saint John of CapistranoPriest (1386 – 1456) St. John of Capistrano guided the Church through a tumultuous era of wars and heresy. His heroic virtues outshone the darkness of heresy and schism. He accomplished the seemingly impossible. As his body became weak, his faith grew mighty. With St. Bernardine of Siena, St. John preached and instilled devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus. He was not spared the contradictions present in the life of every saint, but through them was purified and put deeper trust in God. While preaching and establishing Franciscan communities, he was accused of heresy. After his acquittal, he accomplished the reform of the Order of Friars Minor. St. John preached to thousands, from Germany to Naples. In 1454, he was asked by Pope Callixtus III,at seventy years young, to preach a Crusade in defense of Belgrade, which was being assualted by Ottoman forces. The chivalry of Hungary generously answered his call. He led them, by all accounts, to victory in battle, marching upon and scattering the Ottoman forces with his valiant knights. Himself the son of a German knight in Naples, St. John not only carried the Church, but helped prevent Muslim incursion into Europe. He helped preserve and protect Western Civilization, as the pope would later do by forging alliances and triumphing at the battle of Lepanto. St. John was canonized in 1690 by Pope Alexander VIII.</p><hr /><h3>St. Theodoret(Priest and Martyr (4th century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT THEODORET Martyr (4th century) About the year 361, Julian, uncle to the emperor, and like his nephew an apostate, was made Count of the East. He closed the Christian churches at Antioch. When St. Theodoret assembled the Christians in private, Julian summoned him before a tribunal and had him tortured. St. Theodoret's arms and feet were fastened by ropes to pulleys, and stretched until his body appeared nearly eight feet long. Alban Butler paraphrased the Saint's final moments; but the latter was more likely quiet, like a sheep before its shearers (Is. 53:7). Like the Spotless Lamb, St. Theodoret would only speak from a pure heart and never when indignant; so his words are likely lost in translation: \"O most wretched man,\" he said to the the judge, \"at the day of judgment, the crucified God will send you and the tyrant to hell.\" Count Julian may have shoved this event into the back of his darkened mind full of errors like materialism and narcissism, as he had St. Theodoret dispatched by the sword. Whether the judge ever experienced contrition, repentance and redemption is also in question, but the mercifulness of St. Theodoret following his martyrdom changed the face of the earth as we know it. For God is powerful beyond all belief and blessed in His saints.</p>"

Come on those days to be cured, not on the sabbath day.\"<br />The Lord said to him in reply, \"Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the sabbath untie his ox or his ass from the manger and lead it out for watering?<br />This daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years now, ought she not to have been set free on the sabbath day from this bondage?\"<br />When he said this, all his adversaries were humiliated; and the whole crowd rejoiced at all the splendid deeds done by him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Anthony Mary Claret(Archbishop (1807-1870))</h3><p>SAINT ANTHONY MARY CLARET Claretian Archbishop and Founder (1807-1870) St. Anthony Claret founded The Claretians. Their schools and libraries spanning the globe trace back to St. Anthony’s tireless missions. A reformer and peacemaker, St. Antony abandoned his own will and relied wholly upon the will of Jesus with Mary. St. Anthony was ordained in 1835 after recovering from an illness. His preaching was successful and he championed the cause of the poor. St. Anthony’s works scandalized secular, anti-clerical groups. The threats made on his life saw him sent abroad. When he returned, he founded The Claretians. St. Anthony was elected archbishop of Cuba for his brilliant preaching and apostolic success. By the time he returned, he had survived an assasination attempt. His reforms, which included public schools, credit unions and racial equality were good in the eyes of God, but wrongful in the eyes of men. “Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not have enough room for the books that would be written” (Jn. 21:25). In 1857, St. Anthony was appointed confessor to Queen Isabella of Spain. He built hospitals, colleges and other institutions. Even forced exile did not stop him frompreaching and pursuing missions for education. He passed away on October 24, 1870, in a Cistercian abbey in Fontfroide,Narbonne, southern France.</p><hr /><h3>St. Magloire(Bishop († c. 575))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MAGLOIRE Bishop ( c. 575) St. Magloire was born in Brittany at the end of the fifth century. When he and his cousin, St. Sampson, came of an age, Sampson entered a monastery and Magloire returned home. Magloire's father, Amon, was cured of a dangerous disease by prayer. In response, Magloire, Amon and Amon's wife gave their belongings to the poor and received the habit in Sampson's monastery. When Sampson was elected bishop, Magloire accompanied him in Armorica, or Brittany. St. Magloire resigned his bishopric at seventy years old and retired into a desert on the continent, and some time after into the isle of Jersey. There, he founded another monastery and governed sixty monks. He passed away about the year 575 to be with Jesus and the Church Triumphant forever.</p>"

They went from Rome to preach the Faith in Gaul toward the middle of the third century. Fixing their residence at Soissons, they instructed many in the Faith of Christ. They preached publicly by day, and made shoes at night. Many Celts received faith in Jesus Christ when they preached the Gospel. Like St. Paul, the brothers \"became all things to all people\" (1 Cor. 9:22). Especially effective were their examples of charity, disinterestedness, contempt of earthly glory and heavenly piety. The brothers worked in Gaul for several years before a malicious complaint was lodged against them. The emperor, to gratify their accusers, ordered them tried by Varus, a cruel persecutor of Christians. The brothers were patient and constant under torture, and were martyred by the sword about the year 287.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gaudentius()</h3><hr />"

Narcissus bade the faithful draw water from a neighboring well, prayed over it and told them to put it in the lamps. The water had become oil; and some of it was preserved. The bishop's virtues scandalized certain men; and three false acusers charged him with a henious crime. One narrator says that the accusers confirmed their testimony by horrible imprecations: The first prayed that he might perish by fire, the second wasted by leprosy, and the third struck blind if they charged the bishop falsely. The holy bishop had long desired a life of solitude and withdrew secretly into the desert. But Divine Justice came into effect: Each accuser suffered the penalties he invoked and Bp. Narcissus returned to Jerusalem. Bp. Narcissus passed away in extreme old age. He served as bishop until the end; a servant to the servants; a good shepherd.

Full of zeal for the kingdom of God, he went to Gaul with St. Lucian of Beauvais. They preached the Faith together until reaching Amiens in Picardy, where they parted. Lucian went to Beauvais and sowed the seeds of divine faith in the hearts of many; and received the martyr's crown. St. Quintin lived in Amiens and preached Christ crucified. Unfortunately, his actions scandalized some evil men. They accused him before the local authorities, who had him imprisoned and tortured. His body was pierced with two iron wires from the neck to the thighs, and iron nails were thrust under his nails and in his flesh in many places, particularly into his skull. Lastly, St. Quintin was beheaded. St. Quintin joined the Church triumphant on October 31, 287. He reigns with Christ alongside St. Lucian, the Blessed Virgin Mary and all the saints.</p><hr /><h3>St. Wolfgang()</h3><hr />"
