'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'\"<br />The prophet Jeremiah answered the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people assembled in the house of the LORD,<br />and said: Amen! thus may the LORD do! May he fulfill the things you have prophesied by bringing the vessels of the house of the LORD and all the exiles back from Babylon to this place!<br />But now, listen to what I am about to state in your hearing and the hearing of all the people.<br />From of old, the prophets who were before you and me prophesied war, woe, and pestilence against many lands and mighty kingdoms.<br />But the prophet who prophesies peace is recognized as truly sent by the LORD only when his prophetic prediction is fulfilled.<br />Thereupon the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, broke it,<br />and said in the presence of all the people: \"Thus says the LORD: 'Even so, within two years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, from off the neck of all the nations.'\" At that, the prophet Jeremiah went away.<br />Some time after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:<br />Go tell Hananiah this: Thus says the LORD: By breaking a wooden yoke, you forge an iron yoke!<br />For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: A yoke of iron I will place on the necks of all these nations serving Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and they shall serve him; even the beasts of the field I give him.<br />To the prophet Hananiah the prophet Jeremiah said: Hear this, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, and you have raised false confidence in this people.<br />For this, says the LORD, I will dispatch you from the face of the earth; this very year you shall die, because you have preached rebellion against the LORD.<br />That same year, in the seventh month, Hananiah the prophet died.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>119(118),29.43.79.80.95.102.</em><p>Remove from me the way of falsehood, <br />and favor me with your law.<br />Take not the word of truth from my mouth, <br />for in your ordinances is my hope.<br />Let those who fear you turn to me, <br />those who acknowledge your decrees.<br />May I be wholehearted toward your laws, <br />that I may not be put to shame.<br />The wicked hope to destroy me, <br />but I pay heed to your decrees.<br />From your ordinances I turn not away, <br />for you have instructed me.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>14,13-21.</em><p>When Jesus heard of the death of John the Baptist, he withdrew in a boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from their towns.<br />When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, and he cured their sick.<br />When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said, \"This is a deserted place and it is already late; dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.\"<br />(Jesus) said to them, \"There is no need for them to go away; give them some food yourselves.\"<br />But they said to him, \"Five loaves and two fish are all we have here.\"<br />Then he said, \"Bring them here to me,\"<br />and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing, broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds.<br />They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the fragments left over --twelve wicker baskets full.<br />Those who ate were about five thousand men, not counting women and children.</p><hr /><h3>St. Alphonsus Liguori((1696-1787))</h3><p>SAINT ALPHONSUS MARY DE LIGUORI Bishop and Doctor of the Church (1696-1787) St. Alphonus was born of noble parents near Naples in 1696. His spiritual training was entrusted to the Fathers of the Oratory in that city, and from his boyhood Alphonsus was known as a most devout Brother of the Little Oratory. At the early age of sixteen, he was made doctor in law, and he threw himself into this career with ardor and success. Losing an important case by mistake, St. Alphonsus saw the vanity of human fame and determined to labor only for the glory of God. He entered the priesthood, devoted himself to neglected souls,and founded later the missionary Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer to carry on the work. At the age of sixty-six, St. Alphonsus became Bishop of St. Agatha and zealously undertook the reform of his diocese. He made a vow never to lose time, and though his life was spent in prayer and work, composed a vast number of books, filled with science, unction, and wisdom. He was declared a Doctor of the Church in 1871. St. Alphonsus wrote his first book at the age of forty-nine, and had published about sixty volumes by eighty-three, when his director forbade him to write more. Very many of these books were written in the half-hours snatched from his labors as missionary, religious superior, and Bishop, or in the midst of continual bodily and mental sufferings. With his left hand he would hold a piece of marble against his aching head while his right hand wrote. Yet he counted no time wasted which was spent in charity. He did not refuse to hold a long correspondence with a simple soldier who asked his advice, or to play the harpsichord while he taught his novices to sing spiritual canticles. He was \"a man of sorrows,\" and met with many persecutions and disappointments. For his last seven years, St. Alphonsus was prevented by constant sickness from offering the Eucharist; but he received Holy Communion daily, and his trust in Jesus and Mama Mary sustained him to the end.</p>"

I struck you as an enemy would strike, punished you cruelly;<br />Why cry out over your wound? your pain is without relief. Because of your great guilt, your numerous sins, I have done this to you.<br />Thus says the LORD: See! I will restore the tents of Jacob, his dwellings I will pity; City shall be rebuilt upon hill, and palace restored as it was.<br />From them will resound songs of praise, the laughter of happy men. I will make them not few, but many; they will not be tiny, for I will glorify them.<br />His sons shall be as of old, his assembly before me shall stand firm; I will punish all his oppressors.<br />His leader shall be one of his own, and his rulers shall come from his kin. When I summon him, he shall approach me; how else should one take the deadly risk of approaching me? says the LORD.<br />You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>102(101),16-18.19-21.29.22-23.</em><p>The nations shall revere your name, O LORD, <br />and all the kings of the earth your glory,<br />when the LORD has rebuilt Zion <br />and appeared in his glory;<br />when he has regarded the prayer of the destitute, <br />and not despised their prayer.<br />Let this be written for the generation to come, <br />and let his future creatures praise the LORD:<br />\"The LORD looked down from his holy height, <br />from heaven he beheld the earth,<br />to hear the groaning of the prisoners, <br />to release those doomed to die.\"<br />The children of your servants shall abide, <br />and their posterity shall continue in your presence,<br />that the name of the LORD may be declared on Zion; <br />and his praise, in Jerusalem,<br />when the peoples gather together <br />and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>14,22-36.</em><p>After he had fed the people, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and precede him to the other side of the sea, while he dismissed the crowds.<br />After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When it was evening he was there alone.<br />Meanwhile the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the wind was against it.<br />During the fourth watch of the night, he came toward them, walking on the sea.<br />When the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were terrified. \"It is a ghost,\" they said, and they cried out in fear.<br />At once (Jesus) spoke to them, \"Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.\"<br />Peter said to him in reply, \"Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.\"<br />He said, \"Come.\" Peter got out of the boat and began to walk on the water toward Jesus.<br />But when he saw how (strong) the wind was he became frightened; and, beginning to sink, he cried out, \"Lord, save me!\"<br />Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him, and said to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\"<br />After they got into the boat, the wind died down.<br />Those who were in the boat did him homage, saying, \"Truly, you are the Son of God.\"<br />After making the crossing, they came to land at Gennesaret.<br />When the men of that place recognized him, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought to him all those who were sick<br />and begged him that they might touch only the tassel on his cloak, and as many as touched it were healed.</p><hr /><h3>Peter Faber()</h3><hr /><h3>Peter Faber()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>St. Eusebius of Vercelli(Bishop († 371))</h3><hr />"

They did not receive what had been promised but saw it and greeted it from afar and acknowledged themselves to be strangers and aliens on earth,<br />for those who speak thus show that they are seeking a homeland.<br />If they had been thinking of the land from which they had come, they would have had opportunity to return.<br />But now they desire a better homeland, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.<br />By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer his only son,<br />of whom it was said, \"Through Isaac descendants shall bear your name.\"<br />He reasoned that God was able to raise even from the dead, and he received Isaac back as a symbol.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>12,32-48.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: “Do not be afraid any longer, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.<br />Sell your belongings and give alms. Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.<br />For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.<br />Gird your loins and light your lamps<br />and be like servants who await their master's return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.<br />Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival.

Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more.”</p><hr /><h3>St. Cajetan(Priest (1480-1547))</h3><p>SAINT CAJETAN Priest (1480-1547) St. Cajetan was born at Vicenza, northeastern Italy, in 1480. His parents dedicated him to our blessed Lady; and from childhood, he was nicknamed \"the saint.\" A distinguished student, Cajetan left Vicenza for Rome, where he became the consul at the office of Pope Julius II. Upon the instatement of a new Pope, he returned to Vicenza. He suffered the rancor of his relatives for joining the Confraternity of St. Jerome, whose members were drawn from underpriviledged communities. Now an adult, Cajetan spent his wealth building hospitals and nursing victims of the plague. To renew the lives of the clergy, Cajetan instituted the first community of Regular Clerks, known as Theatines. They devoted themselves to preaching, administration of the sacraments and carefully performing the Church's rites and ceremonies. Cajetan was the first to introduce the Forty Hours' Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament as an antidote to Calvin's heresy. He was lovingly devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In reciprocal love, she placed the infant Jesus in his arms on one Christmas Eve. His mystical experiences and visions were in no way tied to his sufferings, which are more pleasing to God when endured with faith, hope and love. When Germanic clans under the Constable Bourbon sacked Rome, they scourged Cajetan for the riches he had long since given away. Loyal and pure like Jesus, Cajetan endured his trials with manhood that would make us blush, and angels sing. Alban Butler, translating Acta Sanctorum, gives this account of his death: \"When St. Cajetan was on his death-bed, resigned to the will of God, eager for pain to satisfy his love, and for death to attain to life, he beheld the Mother of God, radiant with splendor and surrounded by ministering seraphim. In profound veneration, he said, 'Lady, bless me!' Mary replied, 'Cajetan, receive the blessing of my Son, and know that I am here as a reward for the sincerity of your love, and to lead you to paradise.' She then exhorted him to patience in fighting an evil spirit who troubled him, and gave orders to the choirs of angels to escort his soul in triumph to heaven. Then, turning her countenance full of majesty and sweetness upon him, she said, 'Cajetan, my Son calls thee. Let us go in peace.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Sixtus II()</h3><hr />"

When they moved, the sound of the tumult was like the din of an army. (And when they stood still, they lowered their wings.)<br />Above the firmament over their heads something like a throne could be seen, looking like sapphire. Upon it was seated, up above, one who had the appearance of a man.<br />Upward from what resembled his waist I saw what gleamed like electrum; downward from what resembled his waist I saw what looked like fire; he was surrounded with splendor.<br />Like the bow which appears in the clouds on a rainy day was the splendor that surrounded him. Such was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>148(147),1-2.11-12.13-14.</em><p>Praise the LORD from the heavens; <br />praise him in the heights;<br />praise him, all you his angels; <br />praise him, all you his hosts.<br />Let the kings of the earth and all peoples,<br />young men too, and maidens, <br />old men and boys.<br />Praise the name of the LORD, <br />for his name alone is exalted; <br />his majesty is above earth and heaven.<br />He has lifted up the horn of his people. <br />be this his praise from all his faithful ones, <br />from the children of Israel, the people close to him. <br />Alleluia.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>17,22-27.</em><p>As Jesus and his disciples were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, \"The Son of Man is to be handed over to men,<br />and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.\" And they were overwhelmed with grief.<br />When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and said, \"Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?\"<br />Yes, he said. When he came into the house, before he had time to speak, Jesus asked him, \"What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or census tax? From their subjects or from foreigners?\"<br />When he said, \"From foreigners,\" Jesus said to him, \"Then the subjects are exempt.<br />But that we may not offend them, go to the sea, drop in a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. Open its mouth and you will find a coin worth twice the temple tax. Give that to them for me and for you.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Dominic(Priest (1170-1221))</h3><p>ST DOMINIC Priest (1170-1221) St. Dominic was born in Spain in 1170. As a student, he sold his books to feed the poor during a famine and offered himself as ransom for a slave. At the age of twenty-five, St. Dominic became superior of the Canons Regular of Osma, and accompanied his Bishop to France. There, his heart was well-nigh broken by the ravages of the Albigenian heresy, and his life was henceforth devoted to the conversion of heretics and the defence of the Faith. For this end, he established his threefold religious Order. The convent for nuns was founded first to rescue young girls from heresy and crime. Afterward, a company of apostolic men gathered around him and became the Order of Friar Preachers. Lastly, an organization of laypersons was founded: the Tertiaries, persons of both sexes living in the world. God blessed the new Order, and France, Italy, Spain and England welcomed the Preaching Friars. Our Lady took them under her special protection, and whispered to St. Dominic as he preached. It was in 1208, while St. Dominic knelt in the little chapel of Notre Dame de la Prouille, and implored the great Mother of God to save the Church, that Our Lady appeared to him, gave him the Rosary, and bade him go forth and preach. Beads in hand, St. Dominic converted herectics by the multitudes, with a victory that overcame heresy against overwhelming odds. His nights were spent in prayer; and, though pure as a virgin, thrice before morning broke, he scourged himself, like one tensing his muscles to stave off temptations of the flesh. His words rescued countless souls; and three times he raised the dead to life. At length, on the 6th of August, 1221, at the age of fifty-one, St. Dominic gave up his soul to God; and was welcomed by Our Lady and Lord in Heaven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mary of the Cross Mackillop(Virgin)</h3><hr /><p>Mary of the Cross MacKillop was born on January 15, 1842 in Melbourne, Australia. Conditions in the mid-nineteenth century were still primitive. Poverty was rife, especially in country areas. Religious discrimination was also widespread, and the plight of native, aboriginal people was deplorable. Unemployment was common-place and communication was difficult in the extreme. Travel over any distance was for the fearless and tough. Many of the first settlers were convicts with little education, and many were descendants of Irish Catholics, discriminated against because of their religion and place of origin. The Church had few priests to serve its people who were scattered around rural areas and experiencing poverty. Mary was the first of eight children of Catholic Scottish immigrants, Alexander MacKillop and Flora MacDonald. They imbued their children with a great love for the Church and the supernatural virtues of faith, hope and charity. Their family was poor, and the father was often without work because he dabbled in business and politics. Mary, in her teens, was called upon to assist the family finances by finding employment. At a young age, Mary had increasingly felt the call to live as a religious sister, but she still had the obligation to care for her family. While working as a governess in Penola, she met Father Julian Tenison Woods, who was parish priest of a large part of South East, South Australia. At that period of Australian history, schools, medical care and any form of social services were lacking, especially for the poor. The Catholic rural poor were especially disadvantaged. Mary’s dream of a free education for such children corresponded with the dream of Father Woods. He became her mentor and spiritual director and encouraged her vocation. Together, they developed a plan for a congregation of sisters who would work wherever there was a need, but especially in rural areas. They would live in small convents or in whatever style of dwelling that the local people had. It was a courageous plan. In January 1866, the plan was put into action. Mary and her two sisters began teaching in Penola, South Australia, in a stable refurbished by her brother. With the encouragement and mentoring of Father Woods, the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart was born. On the advice of Father Woods, Mary moved to the main South Australian city of Adelaide. On August 15, 1867, Mary and her companions professed the three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Mary took the name Sister Mary of the Cross. She was joined by other young women, who responded to needs in rural areas where they provided, without payment, elementary teaching in religion and secular subjects to poor children who otherwise had no hope of education. Soon afterward, Mary’s charitable heart opened to the destitute and elderly who were friendless and abandoned in a harsh society without any social welfare. By 1869, there were sixty sisters working in schools, orphanages and refuges for women. Father Woods and Sr Mary envisaged the sisters being governed centrally by one superior and being free to go wherever there was a need anywhere in the colonies. In a short time, the sisters could be found in the other colonies and in New Zealand. A complex set of circumstances led to the Bishop of Adelaide, who was once her friend and benefactor, excommunicating Mary in 1871 for supposed disobedience. Mary accepted the excommunication and the dismissal of many of her sisters with serenity and peace. The Bishop revoked the sentence before his death less than six months later. Mary returned to her work and the majority of the sisters who had been sent away returned to the Institute. Mary was advised to go to Rome to seek the help of Pope Pius IX. Crucial for the institute was the concept of central government, which would enable her to send the sisters anywhere there was a need, rather than be confined to a particular diocese. While in Rome, Mary did not receive final approval for the institute—this came in 1888—but she did receive encouragement from many, and especially from her three meetings with Pope Pius IX. She returned to Australia with support for central government. Back in Australia, further problems arose, and Mary was ordered to leave Adelaide for Sydney. In 1885, she was deposed as Mother General. Mary accepted the changes; retaining respect for the bishops and priesthood and encouraged her sisters to do the same. It was not until 1899 that the sisters were free to elect her as their Mother General, an office she held until her death. Mary was untiring in her zeal for the poor. One of her favorite sayings was, “Never see a need without doing something about it.” Her devotion to the Sacred Heart, the Blessed Sacrament and Saint Joseph impelled her to love God and all persons. Her attention to the will of God enabled her to accept the joys as well as the difficulties that beset her so frequently. She wrote, “The will of God is to me a very dear book and I never tire of reading it.” Throughout her life, Mary suffered from ill health and was often confined to bed with severe and debilitating headaches. Instead of becoming fixated, she lifted her spirit outside of its own self, having her suffering purify her and drawing closer to God. While visiting New Zealand when she was sixty years old, she suffered a stroke. Her right side was impaired, but she learned to write with her left hand and continued in the office of Superior General and even made several visitations to faraway convents. By 1905, deterioration was becoming evident, and for the next years she suffered heroically and kept a cheerful, pleasant outlook on life, always speaking of God’s Will. In 1909, her condition worsened and she died peacefully on August 8, 1909. Her last days were ones of recollection for those who were gathered around her. Cardinal Moran said when he left her, “I have this day attended the death-bed of a saint... Her death will bring many blessings.” One thousand sisters in the Institute mourned her death. Mary’s remains were removed to the Memorial Chapel at the Motherhouse in North Sydney, NSW, Australia. Three popes, Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI have prayed at her tomb, as have thousands of pilgrims annually from all over the world. The lasting memory many sisters had of Mary was her kindness. It was not just the kindness reflected in all the works for which she had been responsible, nor the kindness of an isolated, aloof person but the kindness which St. Paul describes in his first letter to the Corinthians: Love is patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offence and is not resentful. Love... elights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, to endure whatever comes (1 Cor.13: 4-7). During his visit to Sydney for World Youth Day in July 2008, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking about Mary MacKillop, said “I know that her perseverance in the face of adversity, her plea for justice on behalf of those unfairly treated and her practical example of holiness have become a source of inspiration for all Australians.” Quoting St. Mary MacKillop, he said, “Believe in the whisperings of God to your heart. Believe in him. Believe in the power of the Spirit of love.\"</p>"

It was covered with writing front and back, and written on it was: Lamentation and wailing and woe!<br />He said to me: Son of man, eat what is before you; eat this scroll, then go, speak to the house of Israel.<br />So I opened my mouth and he gave me the scroll to eat.<br />Son of man, he then said to me, feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll I am giving you. I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. He said:<br />Son of man, go now to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>119(118),14.24.72.103.111.131.</em><p>In the way of your decrees I rejoice, <br />as much as in all riches.<br />Yes, your decrees are my delight; <br />they are my counselors.<br />The law of your mouth is to me more precious <br />than thousands of gold and silver pieces.<br />How sweet to my palate are your promises, <br />sweeter than honey to my mouth!<br />Your decrees are my inheritance forever; <br />the joy of my heart they are.<br />I gasp with open mouth, <br />in my yearning for your commands.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>18,1-5.10.12-14.</em><p>The disciples approached Jesus and said, \"Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\"<br />He called a child over, placed it in their midst,<br />and said, \"Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.<br />Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<br />And whoever receives one child such as this in my name receives me.<br />See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.<br />What is your opinion? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine in the hills and go in search of the stray?<br />And if he finds it, amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the ninety-nine that did not stray.<br />In just the same way, it is not the will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones be lost.”</p><hr /><h3>St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein)((1891-1942))</h3><p>Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein Nun, Discalced Carmelite, martyrCo-patron of Europe (1891-1942) \"We bow down before the testimony of the life and death of Edith Stein, an outstanding daughter of Israel and at the same time a daughter of the Carmelite Order, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, a personality who united within her rich life a dramatic synthesis of our century. It was the synthesis of a history full of deep wounds that are still hurting ... and also the synthesis of the full truth about man. All this came together in a single heart that remained restless and unfulfilled until it finally found rest in God\" (Pope John Paul II during Edith Stein's beatification in Cologne on 1 May 1987).Who is she? Edith Stein was born in Breslau on the 12th of October 1891, the youngest of 11, as her family were celebrating Yom Kippur, that most important Jewish feast, the Feast of Atonement. \"More than anything else, this helped make the youngest child very precious to her mother.\" Being born on this day was like a foreshadowing to Edith, a future Carmelite nun. Edith's father, who ran a timber business, died when she had only just turned two. Her mother, a very devout, hard-working, strong-willed and truly wonderful woman, now had to fend for herself and to look after the family and their large business. However, she did not succeed in keeping up a living faith in her children. Edith lost her faith in God. \"I consciously decided, of my own volition, to give up praying,\" she said. In 1911, she passed her school-leaving exam with flying colours and enrolled at the University of Breslau to study German and history, though this was a mere \"bread-and-butter\" choice. Her real interest was in philosophy and in women's issues. She became a member of the Prussian Society for Women's Franchise. \"When I was at school and during my first years at university,\" she wrote later, \"I was a radical suffragette. Then I lost interest in the whole issue. Now I am looking for purely pragmatic solutions.\" In 1913, Edith Stein transferred to Göttingen University, to study under the mentorship of Edmund Husserl. She became his pupil and teaching assistant, and he later tutored her for a doctorate. At the time, anyone who was interested in philosophy was fascinated by Husserl's new view of reality, whereby the world as we perceive it does not merely exist in a Kantian way, in our subjective perception. His pupils saw his philosophy as a return to objects: \"back to things\". Husserl's phenomenology unwittingly led many of his pupils to the Christian faith. In Göttingen Edith Stein also met the philosopher Max Scheler, who directed her attention to Roman Catholicism. Nevertheless, she did not neglect her \"bread-and-butter\" studies and passed her degree with distinction in January 1915, though she did not follow it up with teacher training. \"I no longer have a life of my own,\" she wrote at the beginning of the First World War, having done a nursing course and gone to serve in an Austrian field hospital. This was a hard time for her, during which she looked after the sick in the typhus ward, worked in an operating theatre, and saw young people die. When the hospital was dissolved, in 1916, she followed Husserl as his assistant to the German city of Freiburg, where she passed her doctorate summa cum laude (with the utmost distinction) in 1917, after writing a thesis on \"The Problem of Empathy.\" During this period she went to Frankfurt Cathedral and saw a woman with a shopping basket going in to kneel for a brief prayer. \"This was something totally new to me. In the synagogues and Protestant churches I had visited, people simply went to the services. Here, however, I saw someone coming straight from the busy marketplace into this empty church, as if she was going to have an intimate conversation. It was something I never forgot.\" Towards the end of her dissertation she wrote: \"There have been people who believed that a sudden change had occurred within them and that this was a result of God's grace.\" How could she come to such a conclusion? Edith Stein had been good friends with Husserl's Göttingen assistant, Adolf Reinach, and his wife. When Reinach fell in Flanders in November 1917, Edith went to Göttingen to visit his widow. The Reinachs had converted to Protestantism. Edith felt uneasy about meeting the young widow at first, but was surprised when she actually met with a woman of faith. \"This was my first encounter with the Cross and the divine power it imparts to those who bear it ... it was the moment when my unbelief collapsed and Christ began to shine his light on me - Christ in the mystery of the Cross.\" Later, she wrote: \"Things were in God's plan which I had not planned at all. I am coming to the living faith and conviction that - from God's point of view - there is no chance and that the whole of my life, down to every detail, has been mapped out in God's divine providence and makes complete and perfect sense in God's all-seeing eyes.\" In Autumn 1918, Edith Stein gave up her job as Husserl's teaching assistant. She wanted to work independently. It was not until 1930 that she saw Husserl again after her conversion, and she shared with him about her faith, as she would have liked him to become a Christian, too. Then she wrote down the amazing words: \"Every time I feel my powerlessness and inability to influence people directly, I become more keenly aware of the necessity of my own holocaust.\" Edith Stein wanted to obtain a professorship, a goal that was impossible for a woman at the time. Husserl wrote the following reference: \"Should academic careers be opened up to ladies, then I can recommend her whole-heartedly and as my first choice for admission to a professorship.\" Later, she was refused a professorship on account of her Jewishness. Back in Breslau, Edith Stein began to write articles about the philosophical foundation of psychology. However, she also read the New Testament, Kierkegaard and Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. She felt that one could not just read a book like that, but had to put it into practice.In the summer of 1921, she spent several weeks in Bergzabern (in the Palatinate) on the country estate of Hedwig Conrad-Martius, another pupil of Husserl's. Hedwig had converted to Protestantism with her husband. One evening Edith picked up an autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila and read this book all night. \"When I had finished the book, I said to myself: This is the truth.\" Later, looking back on her life, she wrote: \"My longing for truth was a single prayer.\" On the 1st of January 1922, Edith Stein was baptized. It was the Feast of the Circumcision of Jesus, when Jesus entered into the covenant of Abraham. Edith Stein stood by the baptismal font, wearing Hedwig Conrad-Martius' white wedding cloak. Hedwig was her godmother. \"I had given up practising my Jewish religion when I was a 14-year-old girl and did not begin to feel Jewish again until I had returned to God.\" From this moment on she was continually aware that she belonged to Christ not only spiritually, but also through her blood. At the Feast of the Purification of Mary - another day with an Old Testament reference - she was confirmed by the Bishop of Speyer in his private chapel. After her conversion she went straight to Breslau: \"Mother,\" she said, \"I am a Catholic.\" The two women cried. Hedwig Conrad Martius wrote: \"Behold, two Israelites indeed, in whom is no deceit!\" (cf. John 1:47). Immediately after her conversion, she wanted to join a Carmelite convent. However, her spiritual mentors, Vicar-General Schwind of Speyer, and Erich Przywara SJ, stopped her from doing so. Until Easter 1931, she held a position teaching German and History at the Dominican Sisters' school and teacher training college of St. Magdalen's Convent in Speyer. At the same time, she was encouraged by Arch-Abbot Raphael Walzer of Beuron Abbey to accept extensive speaking engagements, mainly on women's issues. \"During the time immediately before and quite some time after my conversion I ... thought that leading a religious life meant giving up all earthly things and having one's mind fixed on divine things only. Gradually, however, I learnt that other things are expected of us in this world... I even believe that the deeper someone is drawn to God, the more he has to `get beyond himself' in this sense, that is, go into the world and carry divine life into it.\" She worked enormously hard, translating the letters and diaries of Cardinal Newman from his pre-Catholic period as well as Thomas Aquinas' Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate. The latter was a very free translation, for the sake of dialogue with modern philosophy. Erich Przywara also encouraged her to write her own philosophical works. She learnt that it was possible to \"pursue scholarship as a service to God... It was not until I had understood this that I seriously began to approach academic work again.\" To gain strength for her life and work, she frequently went to the Benedictine Monastery of Beuron, to celebrate the great feasts of the Church year. In 1931, Edith Stein left the convent school in Speyer and devoted herself to working for a professorship again, this time in Breslau and Freiburg, though her endeavours were in vain. It was then that she wrote Potency and Act, a study of the central concepts developed by Thomas Aquinas. Later, at the Carmelite Convent in Cologne, she rewrote this study to produce her main philosophical and theological oeuvre, Finite and Eternal Being. By then, however, it was no longer possible to print the book. In 1932, she accepted a lectureship position at the Roman Catholic division of the German Institute for Educational Studies at the University of Munster, where she developed her anthropology. She successfully combined scholarship and faith in her work and her teaching, seeking to be a \"tool of the Lord\" in everything she taught. \"If anyone comes to me, I want to lead them to Him.\" In 1933,darkness broke out over Germany. \"I had heard of severe measures against Jews before. But now it dawned on me that God had laid his hand heavily on His people, and that the destiny of these people would also be mine.\" The Aryan Law of the Nazis made it impossible for Edith Stein to continue teaching. \"If I can't go on here, then there are no longer any opportunities for me in Germany,\" she wrote; \"I had become a stranger in the world.\" The Arch-Abbot of Beuron, Walzer, now no longer stopped her from entering a Carmelite convent. While in Speyer, she had already taken a vow of poverty, chastity and obedience. In 1933, she met with the prioress of the Carmelite Convent in Cologne. \"Human activities cannot help us, but only the suffering of Christ. It is my desire to share in it.\" Edith Stein went to Breslau for the last time to say good-bye to her mother and her family. Her last day at home was her birthday, 12 October, which was also the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles. Edith went to the synagogue with her mother. It was a hard day for the two women. \"Why did you get to know it [Christianity]?\" her mother asked, \"I don't want to say anything against him. He may have been a very good person. But why did he make himself God?\" Edith's mother cried. The following day Edith was on the train to Cologne. \"I did not feel any passionate joy. What I had just experienced was too terrible. But I felt a profound peace - in the safe haven of God's will.\" From now on she wrote to her mother every week, though she never received any replies. Instead, her sister Rosa sent her news from Breslau. Edith joined the Carmelite Convent of Cologne on the 14th of October, and her investiture took place on the 15th of April, 1934. The mass was celebrated by the Arch-Abbot of Beuron. Edith Stein was now known as Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce - Teresa, Blessed of the Cross. In 1938 she wrote: \"I understood the cross as the destiny of God's people, which was beginning to be apparent at the time (1933). I felt that those who understood the Cross of Christ should take it upon themselves on everybody's behalf. Of course, I know better now what it means to be wedded to the Lord in the sign of the cross. However, one can never comprehend it, because it is a mystery.\" On the 21st of April 1935, she took her temporary vows. On the 14th of September 1936, the renewal of her vows coincided with her mother's death in Breslau. \"My mother held on to her faith to the last moment. But as her faith and her firm trust in her God... were the last thing that was still alive in the throes of her death, I am confident that she will have met a very merciful judge and that she is now my most faithful helper, so that I can reach the goal as well.\" When she made her eternal profession on the 21st of April 1938, she had the words of St. John of the Cross printed on her devotional picture: \"Henceforth my only vocation is to love.\" Her final work was to be devoted to this author. Edith Stein's entry into the Carmelite Order was not escapism. \"Those who join the Carmelite Order are not lost to their near and dear ones, but have been won for them, because it is our vocation to intercede to God for everyone.\" In particular, she interceded to God for her people: \"I keep thinking of Queen Esther who was taken away from her people precisely because God wanted her to plead with the king on behalf of her nation. I am a very poor and powerless little Esther, but the King who has chosen me is infinitely great and merciful. This is great comfort\" (31st of October 1938). On the 9th of November 1938, the anti-Semitism of the Nazis became apparent to the whole world. Synagogues were burnt, and the Jewish people were subjected to terror. The prioress of the Carmelite Convent in Cologne did her utmost to take Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce abroad. On New Year's Eve 1938, she was smuggled across the border into the Netherlands, to the Carmelite Convent in Echt in the Province of Limburg. This is where she wrote her will on 9th of June 1939: \"Even now I accept the death that God has prepared for me in complete submission and with joy as being his most holy will for me. I ask the Lord to accept my life and my death ... so that the Lord will be accepted by His people and that His Kingdom may come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world.\" While in the Cologne convent, Edith Stein had been given permission to start her academic studies again. Among other things, she wrote about \"The Life of a Jewish Family\" (that is, her own family): \"I simply want to report what I experienced as part of Jewish humanity,\" she said, pointing out that \"we who grew up in Judaism have a duty to bear witness ... to the young generation who are brought up in racial hatred from early childhood.\" In Echt, Edith Stein hurriedly completed her study of \"The Church's Teacher of Mysticism and the Father of the Carmelites, John of the Cross, on the Occasion of the 400th Anniversary of His Birth, 1542-1942.\" In 1941, she wrote to a friend, who was also a member of her order: \"One can only gain a scientia crucis (knowledge of the cross) if one has thoroughly experienced the cross. I have been convinced of this from the first moment onwards and have said with all my heart: 'Ave, Crux, Spes unica' (I welcome you, Cross, our only hope).\" Her study on St. John of the Cross is entitled: \"Kreuzeswissenschaft\" (The Science of the Cross). Edith Stein was arrested by the Gestapo on the 2nd of August 1942 while she was in the chapel with the other sisters. She was to report within five minutes, together with her sister Rosa, who had also converted and was serving at the Echt Convent. Her last words to be heard in Echt were addressed to Rosa: \"Come, we are going for our people.\" Together with many other Jewish Christians, the two women were taken to a transit camp in Amersfoort and then to Westerbork. This was an act of retaliation against the letter of protest written by the Dutch Roman Catholic Bishops against the pogroms and deportations of Jews. Edith commented, \"I never knew that people could be like this, neither did I know that my brothers and sisters would have to suffer like this... I pray for them every hour. Will God hear my prayers? He will certainly hear them in their distress.\" Prof. Jan Nota, who was greatly attached to her, wrote later: \"She is a witness to God's presence in a world where God is absent.\" On the 7th of August, early in the morning, nine hundred eighty-seven Jews were deported to Auschwitz. It was probably on the 9th of August that Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce, her sister and many other of her people were gassed. When Edith Stein was beatified in Cologne on the 1st of May 1987, the Church honoured \"a daughter of Israel,\" as Pope John Paul II put it, \"who, as a Catholic during Nazi persecution, remained faithful to the crucified Lord Jesus Christ and, as a Jew, to her people in loving faithfulness.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Romanus()</h3><hr />"

The Father will honor whoever serves me.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Lawrence(Deacon and Martyr († 258))</h3><p>SAINT LAWRENCE Deacon and Martyr(258)Feast St. Lawrence was the lead among seven deacons of the Roman Church. In 258, he witnessed Pope Sixtus being led to martyrdom. The event surely impacted his outlook. \"I was your ministerwhen you consecrated the blood of our Lord; your sacrifices will never be in vain.\" The holy Pope comforted him with the words, \"Do not be afraid, my son.\" The prefect of the city knew the rich offerings that Christians put into the hands of the clergy, and he demanded the treasures of the Roman Church from Lawrence. The Saint promised, at the end of three days, to show him riches exceeding all the wealth of the empire; and set about collecting the poor, the infirm, and the religious who lived by the alms of the faithful. He then bade the prefect \"see the treasures of the Church\". Christ, whom Lawrence had served in the poor, gave him strength in the conflict which ensued. Roasted over a slow fire, he made sport of his pains. \"I am done enough,\" he said, \"eat, if you will.\" At length Christ, the Father of the poor, received him into Paradise. God's glory shone about St. Lawrence, illuminating the value set upon His love for the poor. Innumerable prayers were granted at St. Lawrence's tomb; and he continues his charity towards us from heaven. As St. Augustine says, Lawrence granted \"the smaller graces which they sought, and leading them to the desire of better gifts.\"</p>"

During the day I brought out my baggage as though it were that of an exile, and at evening I dug a hole through the wall with my hand and, while they looked on, set out in the darkness, shouldering my burden.<br />Then, in the morning, the word of the LORD came to me:<br />Son of man, did not the house of Israel, that rebellious house, ask you what you were doing?<br />Tell them: Thus says the Lord GOD: This oracle concerns Jerusalem and the whole house of Israel within it.<br />I am a sign for you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them; as captives they shall go into exile.<br />The prince who is among them shall shoulder his burden and set out in darkness, going through a hole that he has dug in the wall, and covering his face lest he be seen by anyone.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>78(77),56-57.58-59.61-62.</em><p>They tempted and rebelled against God the Most High, <br />And kept not his decrees.<br />They turned back and were faithless like their fathers; <br />They recoiled like a treacherous bow.<br />They angered him with their high places <br />And with their idols roused his jealousy.<br />God heard and was enraged <br />And utterly rejected Israel.<br />And he surrendered his strength into captivity, <br />His glory in the hands of the foe.<br />He abandoned his people to the sword <br />And was enraged against his inheritance.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>18,21-35.19,1.</em><p>Peter approached Jesus and asked him, \"Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must I forgive him? As many as seven times?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.<br />That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.<br />When he began the accounting, a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.<br />Since he had no way of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all his property, in payment of the debt.<br />At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'<br />Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.<br />When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount.

I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.<br />Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?'<br />Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.<br />So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\"<br />When Jesus finished these words, he left Galilee and went to the district of Judea across the Jordan.</p><hr /><h3>St. Clare(Virgin (1194-1253))</h3><p>SAINT CLARE Virgin(1194-1253) On Palm Sunday, March 17, 1212, the Bishop of Assisi left the altar to present a palm to a noble maiden, eighteen years of age, whom bashfulness had detained in her place. This maiden was St. Clare. Already she had learnt from St. Francis to hate the world's vanities, and was secretly resolved to live for God alone. She had escaped with one companion to the Church of the Portiuncula, where she was met by St. Francis and his brethren. At the altar of Our Lady, St. Francis cut off her hair, clothed her in his habit of penance, a piece of sack-cloth, with his cord as a girdle. Thus she was espoused to Christ. In a rustic house outside Assisi, she founded her Order, and was joined by her sister, fourteen years of age, and afterwards by her mother and other noble ladies. They went barefoot, observed perpetual abstinence, constant silence, and perfect poverty. While the Saracen army of Frederick II was ravaging the valley of Spoleto, a body of marauders advanced to assault St. Clare's convent outside Assisi. The Saint caused the Blessed Sacrament to be placed in a monstrance, above the gate of the monastery facing the enemy, and kneeling before it, prayed, \"Deliver us, O Lord, the souls of those who confess to Thee.\" A voice from the Host replied, \"My protection will never fail you.\" A sudden panic seized the attacking mercenaries, who took to flight, and the Saint's convent was spared. St. Clare was born to eternal life in 1253 while the Passion was being read, and the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to those present.</p><hr /><h3>St. Philomena()</h3><hr />"

Rather, you were thrown out on the ground as something loathsome, the day you were born.<br />Then I passed by and saw you weltering in your blood. I said to you: Live in your blood<br />and grow like a plant in the field. You grew and developed, you came to the age of puberty; your breasts were formed, your hair had grown, but you were still stark naked.<br />Again I passed by you and saw that you were now old enough for love. So I spread the corner of my cloak over you to cover your nakedness; I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you; you became mine, says the Lord GOD.<br />Then I bathed you with water, washed away your blood, and anointed you with oil.<br />I clothed you with an embroidered gown, put sandals of fine leather on your feet; I gave you a fine linen sash and silk robes to wear.<br />I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms, a necklace about your neck,<br />a ring in your nose, pendants in your ears, and a glorious diadem upon your head.<br />Thus you were adorned with gold and silver; your garments were of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. Fine flour, honey, and oil were your food. You were exceedingly beautiful, with the dignity of a queen.<br />You were renowned among the nations for your beauty, perfect as it was, because of my splendor which I had bestowed on you, says the Lord GOD.<br />But you were captivated by your own beauty, you used your renown to make yourself a harlot, and you lavished your harlotry on every passer-by, whose own you became.<br />Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you when you were a girl, and I will set up an everlasting covenant with you.<br />that you may remember and be covered with confusion, and that you may be utterly silenced for shame when I pardon you for all you have done, says the Lord GOD.</p><h3>Book of Isaiah</h3><em>12,2-3.4bcd.5-6.</em><p>God indeed is my savior; <br />I am confident and unafraid. <br />My strength and my courage is the LORD, <br />and he has been my savior.<br />With joy you will draw water <br />at the fountain of salvation.<br />Give thanks to the LORD, acclaim his name;<br />among the nations make known his deeds,<br />proclaim how exalted is his name.<br />Sing praise to the LORD for his glorious achievement; <br />let this be known throughout all the earth.<br />Shout with exultation, O city of Zion, <br />for great in your midst <br />is the Holy One of Israel!</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>19,3-12.</em><p>Some Pharisees approached Jesus, and tested him, saying, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?\"<br />He said in reply, \"Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'<br />and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?<br />So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.\"<br />They said to him, \"Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss (her)?\"<br />He said to them, \"Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.<br />I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.\"<br />(His) disciples said to him, \"If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.\"<br />He answered, \"Not all can accept (this) word, but only those to whom that is granted.<br />Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Jane Frances de Chantal (1572-1641)()</h3><p>SAINT JANE FRANCES DE CHANTAL(1572-1641) At the age of sixteen, Jane Frances de Frémyot, already an orphan, was placed under the care of a worldly-minded governess. In this crisis, she offered herself to the Mother of God and secured Mary's protection for life. When a Protestant sought her hand, she refused to marry one who lacked character and morals,and shortly afterward married Baron de Chantal, who gave her the home and heart of a fully Christian man. But God had marked her for something higher than domestic sanctity. Two children and a dearly beloved sister died, and, in the full tide of prosperity, her husband's life was taken by the innocent hand of a friend. For seven years, the sorrows of her widowhood were increased by ill-usage from servants and the importunities of friends who urged her to marry again. Harassed almost to despair, she branded Jesus' name over her heart and left her home and children to live for God alone. On March 19, 1609, Madame de Chantal bade farewell to her family and relations. With tenderness and affection, she passed around the large room, sweetly and humbly taking leave of each. Her son, a boy of fifteen, used every entreaty and endearment to induce his mother not to leave; and at last flung himself across the door of the room. In an agony of distress, she passed over her son to the embrace of her aged and disconsolate father. The anguish of that parting reached its height when she obtained his last blessing, promising to repay his sacrifices by her prayers. Well might St. Francis call her \"the valiant woman.\" She was to found, with St. Francis de Sales, a great Order. Sickness, opposition and want beset her, and the death of children, friends, and of St. Francis himself followed, while eighty-seven houses of the Visitation rose. Nine long years of interior desolation completed the work of God's grace; and in her seventieth year, St. Vincent of Paul saw, at the moment of her death, her soul called to heaven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Euplius()</h3><hr />"

When a war ensued, our Saint, at the age of twelve, was made prisoner and carried captive by Clotaire, King of Soissons, who had her instructed in the Christian faith and baptized. The great mysteries of Faith made such an impression on her tender soul that she gave herself to God with her whole heart, and desired to consecrate to him her virginity. She was obliged at last, however, to yield to the king's wish that she should become his wife. As a great queen, she continued no less an enemy to sloth and vanity than she was before, and divided her time chiefly between her oratory, the Church, and the care of the poor. She also kept long fasts, and during Lent wore a hair-cloth under her rich garments. King Clotaire was at first pleased with her devotions, and allowed her full liberty in them, but later reproached her for her pious exercises, saying he had married a nun rather than a queen, who converted his court into a monastery. Seeing that Clotaire was inflamed by bad passions, our Saint asked and obtained his leave to retire from court. She went to Noyon, and was consecrated deaconess by St. Medard. St. Radegundes first withdrew to Sais, and some time after she went to Poitiers, and there built a great monastery. She had a holy virgin, named Agnes, made the first abbess, and paid to her an implicit obedience in all things, not reserving to herself the disposal of the least thing. King Clotaire, repenting of his evil conduct, wished her to return to court, but, through the intercession of St. Germanus of Paris, she was allowed to remain in her retirement, where she passed away on the 13th of August, 587.</p><hr /><h3>St. John Berchmans()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Sts.

The Kolbe home was poor but full of love. The parents, hardworking and religious, educated their three sons with rectitude. Around 1906, an event took place that marks a fundamental milestone in the life of the young boy. His mother herself related the event a few months after her son's martyrdom. \"I knew ahead of time, based on an extraordinary event that took place in his infancy, that Maximilian would die a martyr. I just don't recall if it took place before or after his first confession. Once I did not like one of his pranks and I reproached him for it: 'My son, what ever will become of you?!' Later, I did not think of it again, but I noticed that the boy had changed so radically, he was hardly recognizable. We had a small altar hidden between two dressers before which he used to often retire without being noticed and he would pray there crying. In general, he had a conduct superior to his age, always recollected and serious and when he prayed he would burst into tears. I was worried, thinking he had some sort of illness so I asked him: 'Is there anything wrong? You should share everything with your mommy!' Trembling with emotion and with his eyes flooded in tears, he shared: 'Mama, when you reproached me, I pleaded with the Blessed Mother to tell me what would become of me. At Church I did the same; I prayed the same thing again. So then the Blessed Mother appeared to me holding in her hands two crowns: one white the other red. She looked at me with tenderness and asked me if I wanted these two crowns. The white one signified that I would preserve my purity and the red that I would be a martyr. I answered that I accepted them...(both of them). Then the Virgin Mary looked at me with sweetness and disappeared.' The extraordinary change in the boys' behavior testified to me the truth of what he related. He was fully conscious and as he spoke to me, with his face radiating; it showed me his desire to die a martyr.\" When he was 13 years old he entered the Franciscan Fathers Seminary in the Polish city of Lvov, which was at that time occupied by Austria. It was in the seminary where he adopted the name Maximilian. He completed his studies in Rome. Before his ordination as a priest in 1918, Maximilian founded the Immaculata Movement devoted to our Lady. He spread the movement through a magazine entitled \"The Knight of the Immaculata.\" \"We should conquer the universe and each soul, now and in the future until the end of time, for the Immaculata and through her for the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\" (St. Maximilian Maria Kolbe, The Knight of the Immaculata) Maximilian went to Japan and then on to India where he furthered the Movement. After a few years in Japan, he was summoned back to Poland, largely due to his ever-declining health. Three years later, in the midst of the Second World War, he was imprisoned along with other friars and sent to concentration camps in Germany and Poland. In February of 1941, he was again imprisoned and sent to the concentration camp in Auschwitz, where in spite of the terrible living conditions, he continued his ministry. On July 31st, 1941, in reprisal for one prisoner's escape, ten men were chosen to die. Father Kolbe offered himself in place of a young husband and father. He was the last to die after two weeks of starvation, thirst, and neglect. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1982 as a Martyr of Charity.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Eberhard()</h3><hr />"

He sent to Pope Sylvester, asking him to appoint bishops to the eleven sees he had endowed. The Pope granted his requests, and crowned Stephen King of Hungary. King Stephen's humility was heroic. He placed his kingdom under the protection of our blessed Lady, gave and enforced good laws and served his people as he served Jesus. His only wars were wars of defence, and he was always successful. God sent him many and sore trials. One by one his children died, but he bore everything with perfect reliance upon the will of God. Before King Stephen died, he urged Hungary's bishops and nobles to nurture and cherish the Catholic Church, which was still as a tender plant in Hungary. He passed away during thefeast day of the Assumption of Mary. Attaining the beatific vision and beholding God gave to face, St. Stephen intercedes on our behalf forever and ever.</p>"

Should not shepherds, rather, pasture sheep?<br />You have fed off their milk, worn their wool, and slaughtered the fatlings, but the sheep you have not pastured.<br />You did not strengthen the weak nor heal the sick nor bind up the injured. You did not bring back the strayed nor seek the lost, but you lorded it over them harshly and brutally.<br />So they were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and became food for all the wild beasts. My sheep were scattered<br />and wandered over all the mountains and high hills; my sheep were scattered over the whole earth, with no one to look after them or to search for them.<br />Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:<br />As I live, says the Lord GOD, because my sheep have been given over to pillage, and because my sheep have become food for every wild beast, for lack of a shepherd; because my shepherds did not look after my sheep, but pastured themselves and did not pasture my sheep;<br />because of this, shepherds, hear the word of the LORD:<br />Thus says the Lord GOD: I swear I am coming against these shepherds. I will claim my sheep from them and put a stop to their shepherding my sheep so that they may no longer pasture themselves. I will save my sheep, that they may no longer be food for their mouths.<br />For thus says the Lord GOD: I myself will look after and tend my sheep.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>23(22),1-3a.3b-4.5.6.</em><p>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br />In verdant pastures he gives me repose; <br />beside restful waters he leads me;<br />he refreshes my soul. <br />He guides me in right paths<br />for His names's sake.<br />Even though I walk in the dark valley <br />I fear no evil; for you are at my side <br />with your rod and your staff <br />that give me courage.<br />You spread the table before me <br />in the sight of my foes; <br />You anoint my head with oil; <br />my cup overflows.<br />Only goodness and kindness follow me <br />all the days of my life; <br />and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD <br />for years to come.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>20,1-16a.</em><p>Jesus told his disciples this parable: \"The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out at dawn to hire laborers for his vineyard.<br />After agreeing with them for the usual daily wage, he sent them into his vineyard.<br />Going out about nine o'clock, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace,<br />and he said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard, and I will give you what is just.'<br />So they went off.

Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?<br />Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you?<br />(Or) am I not free to do as I wish with my own money?

Born to noble Polish parents in 1185, he received his calling and vocation to give his existence singularly to Christ. In 1218, being already Canon of Cracow, he accompanied his uncle, the bishop of Cracow, to Rome. There, St. Hyacinth met St. Dominic and received the habit of Friar Preachers. His progress in virtue was so stunning that St. Dominic sent him topreach and plant the Order in Poland. Once there, St. Hyacinth founded two houses. St. Hyacinth's apostolic journeys extended over numerous regions. He evangelized in Austria, Bohemia, Livonia, on the shores of the Black Sea, Tartary, and Northern China. To the West, he evangelized Sweden, Norway and Scotland. Churches and convents were built thanks to his work. Miracles are also connected to his intercession. St. Hyacinth inherited St. Dominic's filial confidence in the Mother of God. She guided his vocation and secured his final perseverance. When St. Hyacinth was at Kiev and the Tartars attacked, he rescued the ciborium and a Statue of Mary from being looted, but only after finishing the Mass. The statue was made of heavy alabaster, but when Hyacinth took in it in his arms, it became light as a reed. He came to the other side of the riverDnieper carrying the Statue and the Eucharist, as if he walked on water. On the eve of the Assumption, St. Hyacinth was told by an angel of his impending death. Despite extreme physical weakness, he celebrated Mass the next day. Shortly afterward, he was annointed and passed away at the foot of the altar.</p>"

But he was reduced to silence.<br />Then the king said to his attendants, 'Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the darkness outside, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'<br />Many are invited, but few are chosen.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga(Priest (1901-1952))</h3><p>Saint Alberto Hurtado CruchagaPriest(1901-1952) Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga was born in Viña del Mar, Chile, on the 22nd of January 1901; he was orphaned when he was four years old by the death of his father. His mother had to sell, at a loss, their modest property in order to pay the family's debts. As a further consequence, Alberto and his brother had to go to live with relatives and were often moved from one family to another. From an early age, therefore, he experienced what it meant to be poor, to be without a home and at the mercy of others. He was given a scholarship to the Jesuit College in Santiago. There, he became a member of the Sodality of Our Lady and developed a lively interest in the poor, spending time with them in the most miserable neighborhoods every Sunday afternoon. When he completed his secondary education in 1917, Alberto wanted to become a Jesuit, but was advised to postpone in order to take care of his mother and younger brother. By working in the afternoons and evenings, he succeeded in supporting them. At the same time, he studied law at the Catholic University. In this period, he maintained his care for the poor and continued to visit them every Sunday. Obligatory military service interrupted his studies, but once he fulfilled this duty, he went on to earn his degree in August 1923. On the 14th of August 1923, he entered the Novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Chillán. In 1925, he went to Córdoba, Argentina, where he studied humanities. In 1927, he was sent to Spain to study philosophy and theology. However, because of the suppression of the Jesuits in Spain in 1931, he went on to Belgium and continued studying theology at Louvain. He was ordained a priest there on the 24th of August 1933, and in 1935 obtained a doctorate in pedagogy and psychology. After having completed his Tertianship in Drongen, Belgium, he returned to Chile in January 1936. He began his activity as professor of religion at Colegio San Ignacio and of Pedagogy at the Catholic University of Santiago. He was entrusted with the Sodality of Our Lady for the students, and he involved them in teaching catechism to the poor. He frequently directed retreats and offered spiritual direction to many young men, accompanying several of them in their response to the priestly vocation and contributing in an outstanding manner to the formation of many Christian laymen. In 1941, Father Hurtado published his most famous book: \"Is Chile a Catholic Country?\" The same year, he was asked to assume the role of Assistant for the Youth Movement of the Catholic Action, first within the Archdiocese of Santiago and then nationally. He performed these roles with an exceptional spirit of initiative, dedication and sacrifice. In October 1944, while giving a retreat, he felt impelled to appeal to his audience to consider the many poor people of the city, especially the numerous homeless children who were roaming the streets of Santiago. This request evoked a ready and generous response. This was the beginning of the initiative for which Father Hurtado is especially well-known: a form of charitable activity which provided not only housing but a home-like milieu for the homeless: \"El Hogar de Cristo.\" By means of contributions from benefactors and with the active collaboration of committed laity, Father Hurtado opened the first house for children. This was followed by a house for women and then one for men. The poor found a warm home in \"El Hogar de Cristo.\" The houses multiplied and took on new dimensions. In some houses, there were rehabilitation centers; in others, trade-schools, and so on. All were inspired and permeated by Christian values. In 1945, Father Hurtado visited the United States to study the \"Boys Town\" movement and to consider how it could be adapted to his own country. The last six years of his life were dedicated to the development of various forms in which \"El Hogar\" could exist and function. In 1947, Father Hurtado founded the Chilean Trade Union Association (ASICH) to promote a union movement inspired by the social teaching of the Church. Between 1947 and 1950, Father Hurtado wrote three important works: on trade unions, on social humanism, and on the Christian social order. In 1951, he founded \"Mensaje,\" the well-known Jesuit periodical dedicated to explaining the doctrine of the Church. Pancreatic cancer brought him, within a few months, to the end of his life. In the midst of terrible pain, he was often heard to say, \"I am content, Lord.\" After having spent his life manifesting Christ's love for the poor, Father Hurtado was called to the Lord on the 18th of August 1952. From his return to Chile after his Tertianship to his death, a matter of only fifteen years, Father Hurtado lived and accomplished all the works described above. His apostolate was the expression of a personal love for Christ the Lord; it was characterized by a great love for poor and abandoned children, an enlightened zeal for the formation of the laity, and a lively sense of Christian social justice. Fr. Hurtado was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 23rd, 2005.</p>"

While still a boy, he made a vow of perpetual chastity after receiving Holy Communion. At school, where he was very proficient in his studies, he was conspicuous for his remarkable piety. He had the greastest love for the Blessed Virgin, and burned with a marvelous love for his neighbor. John enrolled himself in the Congregation of the Oratory founded by Cardinal de Berullé and was ordained a priest at Paris. He was made rector of the Oratorian house at Caen, but later withdrew from the congregation to educate suitable parishioners for the ministry of the Church. Accordingly, with five associates, he founded a congregation of priests and gave it the most holy names of Jesus and Mary. He opened the first seminary at Caen, and it was followed afterwards by many others elsewhere. That he might recall women of immoral life to the Christian life, he founded the Institute of Our Lady of Charity, of which the Congregation of the Good Shepherd of Angers is a branch. Among his other works of charity is the Society of the Admirable Heart of the Mother of God. Burning with singular love towards the most holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary, he was the first to promote their liturgical worship by divine inspiration. As an apostolic missionary, he preached the Gospel in many villages and cities. Weakened almost to death by so many labors, he peacefully expired on the tenth of the Nones of August in the year 1680.</p>"

The grace of his person and the vigor of his intellect filled his parents with the highest hopes, yet they accepted his decision to join the monks at Citeaux with serenity. All his brothers followed Bernard to Citeaux except Nivard, the youngest, who was left to care for their father in his old age. Desiring to consecrate his life to God, the younger brother also left to join the monks; followed shortly after by the father. Only one sister remained; and she was married. She visited St. Bernard one day, and the words he spoke so moved her that she retired to a convent two years later. St. Bernard's holy example attracted so many novices that other monasteries were erected. As abbot of the monastery at Clairvaux, he was at first unsparing. However, the love of Christ brought about metanoia, and St. Bernard found himself acting in his capacity as the living image of Christ. The Holy Spirit confirmed his works, so much that churches requested for him to become their bishop. In order to perfect the work he had begun, St. Bernard declined promotion with the help of Pope Eugenius III, his former disciple. Although an abbot, St. Bernard was constantly sought after by the poor and the guilty for protection. He served as consultant to bishops, kings and popes. St. Bernard passed away in 1153. His writings have earned for him the titles of the last of the Church Fathers and a Doctor of the Church.</p>"

For what \"son\" is there whom his father does not discipline?<br />At the time, all discipline seems a cause not for joy but for pain, yet later it brings the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who are trained by it.<br />So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees.<br />Make straight paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be dislocated but healed.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>13,22-30.</em><p>Jesus passed through towns and villages, teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem.<br />Someone asked him, \"Lord, will only a few people be saved?\" He answered them,<br />Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough.<br />After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door, then will you stand outside knocking and saying, 'Lord, open the door for us.'

When she was born in Lima, Peru, in 1586, she was christened Isabel. However, the beauty of her features got her nicknamed Rose. While in the cradle, Rose's silence during a painful surgical operation showed her uniqueness. She began working at an early age to support her parents, but in spite of hardships and austerities, her beauty only grew. Being openly admired, she cut off her hair for fear of vanity and blistered her face with pepper and her hands with lime. In full possession of the beatitudes with her vocation before her eyes, Rose enrolled in the Third Order of St. Dominic, and took St. Catherine of Siena as her model. Her cell was a garden hut and her couch a box of broken tiles. Under her habit, Rose wore a hair-shirt studded with iron nails. A silver crown armed with ninety points encircled her head, which she concealed with a veil. More than once, when she shuddered at the prospect of a night of hardship, a voice said, \"My cross was more painful.\" The Blessed Sacrament was her soul's food and singular delight. All her sufferings were offered for the conversion of sinners, and the thought of the multitudes in hell was always before her. She passed away in 1617 at the age of thirty-one. Joining Jesus and the Saints in heaven, St. Rose intercedes on behalf of the pure and humble of heart.</p>"

St. Bartholomew is mentioned among the disciples who met together in prayer after Christ's ascension. Praying together with the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Bartholomew received from Jesus the Holy Spirit in the form of tongues of fire. Being justified by grace to discharge the functions of an apostle, St. Bartholomew carried the Gospel to the ends of the earth. He preacheed as far as Bombay, India, before returning to northwest Asia. There, he met St. Philip at Hierapolis in Phrygia, and afterward travelled into Lycaonia. St. Bartholomew's last mission was into Greater Armenia. While preaching the Gospel in a place of pagan worship and idolatry, St. Bartholomew was arrested, flayed alive, and eventually crucified. His sacrifice is a historical link to Western Civilization's principle of freedom of speech and dialogue.</p>"

King of France at the age of twelve, Louis made the defence of God's honor the aim of his life. Before two years, he had crushed the Albigensian heretics and forced them by stringent penalties to respect the Catholic faith. Amidst the cares of government, King Louis daily recited the Divine Office and heard two Masses; and the most glorious churches in France are still monuments of his piety. When his courtiers remonstrated with him for his law that blasphemers should be branded on the lips, he replied, \"I would willingly have my own lips branded to root out blasphemy from my kingdom.\" A fearless protector of the weak and oppressed, King Louis was chosen to arbitrate in the great feuds of his day, between the Pope and the Emperor, between Henry III and the English barons. In 1248, to reclaim the land of Christianity and Judaism, he gathered the chivalry of France and embarked on a Crusade. During the conflict, King Louis proved himself the truest of Christian knights, receiving both victory and defeat, remaining constant in sickness and captivity. When held captive at Damietta, an Emir rushed into his tent brandishing a dagger red with the Sultan's blood. The Emir threatened to stab King Louis unless he conferred knighthood, as Emperor Frederick had done with Facardin. King Louis calmly replied that no unbeliever could perform the duties of a Christian knight. When offered freedom on condition of blaspheming, and despite a threat to massacre the Christians, King Louis inflexibly refused. The death of King Louis' mother recalled him to France; but once order was reestablished, he again set forth on a second crusade. In August, 1270, his army landed at Tunis, and though victorious over the enemy, King Louis succumbed to a malignant fever. He received the Viaticum kneeling by his camp-bed, and gave up his life to God.</p>"

Go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.'<br />While they went off to buy it, the bridegroom came and those who were ready went into the wedding feast with him.

That year, Emeperor Severus raised the fifth and most bloody persecution against the Church, which continued until his death in 211. During the persecution, St. Zephyrinus was the support and comfort of the Christians, and he suffered by charity and compassion what every confessor underwent. The triumphs of the martyrs were indeed his joy, but his heart received many deep wounds from the fall of apostates and heretics. Neither did this latter affliction cease when peace was restored to the Church. Eusebius tells us that this holy Pope exerted his zeal so strenuously against the blasphemies of the heretics that they treated him in the most contemptuous manner. However, the words of Christ during His Sermon on the Mount ring true: \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven (Mt. 5:11-12).\" St. Zephyrinus filled the pontifical chair nineteen years, passing away in 217. He was buried in his own cemetery on the 26th of August. He is styled a martyr by what he suffered even though he was not killed.</p>"

A girlhood of singular innocence and piety, she was given in marriage to Patritius, a pagan. She at once devoted herself to his conversion, praying for him always, and winning his reverence and love by the holiness of her life and her affectionate forbearance. She was rewarded by seeing him baptized a year before his death. When Augustine went astray in faith and manners, her prayers and tears were incessant. She was once very urgent with a learned bishop that he would talk to her son in order to bring him to a better mind, but the bishop declined, saying that he despaired of success against one so able and headstrong. However, on witnessing St. Monica's prayers and tears, he said, \"take courage,\" for it might not be that the child of those tears should perish. By going to Italy, Augustine freed himself from his mother's importunities; but he could not escape from her prayers, which encompassed him like the providence of God. She followed him to Italy, and there, by his marvellous conversion, her sorrow was turned into joy. At Ostia, on their homeward journey, as Augustine and his mother sat at a window speaking about the life of the blessed, she turned to him and said, \"Son, there is nothing now I care for in this life. My one reason was seeing you become a Christian.\" A few days afterward, St. Monica was brought low by a fever, and passed away in the year 387.</p>"

He was brought up in the Christian faith, but was not baptized. An ambitious school-boy of brilliant talents and violent passions, he early lost both his faith and his innocence. He persisted in his irregular life until he was thirty-two. Being then at Milan professing rhetoric, he tells us that the faith of his childhood had regained possession of his intellect, but that he could not as yet resolve to break the chains of evil habit. One day, however, stung to the heart by the account of some sudden conversions, he cried out, \"The unlearned rise and storm heaven, and we, with all our learning, for lack of heart lie wallowing here.\" He then withdrew into a garden, where a long and terrible conflict ensued. Suddenly, a young fresh voice (he knows not whose) breaks in upon his strife with the words, \"Take and read\"; and he lights upon the passage, \"Walk honestly as in the day.\" The battle was won, and Augustine received baptism. He returned home and gave everything to the poor and the Church. At Hippo, where he settled, he was consecrated bishop in 395. For thirty-five years, he was the center of ecclesiastical life in Africa, and the Church's mightiest champion against heresy. His writings have been accepted everywhere as one of the principal sources of devotional thought and theological speculation.</p><hr /><h3>St. Edmund Arrowsmith()</h3><hr />"

Do not be terrified on account of them, or I will terrify you before them;<br />For I am the one who today makes you a fortified city, a pillar of iron, a wall of bronze, against the whole land: against Judah’s kings and princes, its priests and the people of the land.<br />They will fight against you, but not prevail over you, for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>71(70),1-2.3-4a.5-6ab.15ab.17.</em><p>In you, LORD, I take refuge; <br />let me never be put to shame.<br />In your justice rescue and deliver me; <br />incline your ear to me, and save me.<br />Be my rock of refuge, <br />a stronghold to give me safety, <br />for you are my rock and my fortress.<br />O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked.<br />For you are my hope, O Lord; <br />my trust, O God, from my youth.<br />On you I depend from birth;<br />from my mother's womb you are my strength.<br />My mouth shall declare your justice,<br />day by day your salvation.<br />O God, you have taught me from my youth, <br />and till the present I proclaim your wondrous deeds.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>6,17-29.</em><p>Herod was the one who had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, whom he had married.<br />John had said to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\"<br />Herodias harbored a grudge against him and wanted to kill him but was unable to do so.<br />Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and kept him in custody. When he heard him speak he was very much perplexed, yet he liked to listen to him.<br />She had an opportunity one day when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers, his military officers, and the leading men of Galilee.<br />Herodias's own daughter came in and performed a dance that delighted Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, \"Ask of me whatever you wish and I will grant it to you.\"<br />He even swore (many things) to her, \"I will grant you whatever you ask of me, even to half of my kingdom.\"<br />She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?\" She replied, \"The head of John the Baptist.\"<br />The girl hurried back to the king's presence and made her request, \"I want you to give me at once on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\"<br />The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests he did not wish to break his word to her.<br />So he promptly dispatched an executioner with orders to bring back his head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison.<br />He brought in the head on a platter and gave it to the girl. The girl in turn gave it to her mother.<br />When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</p><hr /><h3>St. Medericus()</h3>"

Beatified by Pope John Paul II on October 3, 1982; and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 11, 2009; her virtues and intercession are everlasting. She grew up in a small town in revolutionary France. When those who openly practiced their faith were either imprisoned or killed, Jeanne received her faith formation from her mother and a group of women who belonged to a lay movement.When St. Jeanne was 4, her father was lost at sea. Her mother found odd jobs to make ends meet. When a young girl, St. Jeanne worked as a shepherdess. She also knit and spun wool. A while later, she went on to work as a maid for a wealthy family. Despite having a modest education, St. Jeanne's heart was ablaze. Now, barely out of her teens, St. Jeanne felt the call of divine love. She told her mother, \"God wants me for himself. He is keeping me for a work which is not yet founded.\" After, she set to work among the poor in a local hospital.One cold winter night, St. Jean encountered Jesus in the person of an elderly, blind, infirm woman, who was dying in the cold. St. Jeanne carried the woman home, lifted her up the stairs to her small room, and placed the woman in her bed. Henceforth, St. Jeanne would sleep in the attic, as she made her home into a refuge for the destitute and marginalized in revolutionary France.God instilled great fervor and zealousness in Jeanne. Many women responded to the call, the invitation to serve. By the working of the Holy Spirit, a religious community was born. The local citizens were struck by their spirit of humble service, and called the group the Little Sisters of the Poor; and the name stuck. From then on, their order spread across France and beyond.Although her Order's foundress, St. Jeanne was early-on demoted by eclesiastical authorities and an ambitious priest was placed in charge. St. Jeanne was sent out begging by the new Superior of the Order she had founded. In time, St. Jeanne was placed in retirement. At the time of her passing, 27 years later, the nacent Little Sisters had no idea St. Jeanne was their foundress. St. Jeanne said, \"We are grafted onto the Cross, and we must carry it joyfully.\" Her rich spiritual reflections continue yielding grace and illuminating spiritual realities.In her words:\"Be very little before God.\" ... \"It is so good to be poor, ... (relinquishing everything), and depending on God for everything.\" ... \"God will help us; the work is His.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Fiaker(Anchorite († c. 670))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT FIAKER Anchorite( c. 670) St. Fiaker was born in Ireland and educated by a bishop, who some say was Conan, Bishop of Soder or the Western Islands. Rejecting worldly vanity, he renounced a splendid career to live as a mystic. He then sailed to France to maintain holy solitude. Divine Providence conducted Fiaker to St. Faro, who was the Bishop of Meaux. When they met, the prelate discerned Fiaker's marks of extraordinary virtue and ability; and gave the latter a solitary dwelling in a forest called Breuil. In this place, the holy Anchorite cleared the ground of trees and briers, made himself a cell, with a small garden, and built an oratory in honor of the Blessed Virgin, in which he spent a great part of the days and nights in devout prayer. He tilled his garden and labored with his own hands for subsistence. Fiaker constantly maintained the presence of God, and only necessity or charity interrupted his exercises. Many approached him for advice and the poor of spirit for divine gifts. But following the Trish monks' rule, he never had a woman enter his personal enclosure. St. Chillen, or Kilian, an Irish nobleman, visited St. Fiaker on his return from Rome. With time under Fiaker's disciple, St. Kilian went on to preach in the neighboring dioceses with every bishops' approval. Selfless and loyal to the end, St. Fiaker awaits us, the Church Militant, on the threshold of heaven, praying and interceding for us until the end of time.</p><hr /><h3>St. Pammachius()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

She got up immediately and waited on them.<br />At sunset, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. He laid his hands on each of them and cured them.<br />And demons also came out from many, shouting, \"You are the Son of God.\" But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.<br />At daybreak, Jesus left and went to a deserted place. The crowds went looking for him, and when they came to him, they tried to prevent him from leaving them.<br />But he said to them, \"To the other towns also I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this purpose I have been sent.\"<br />And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</p><hr /><h3>St. Raymund Nonnatus (1204-1240)()</h3><p>SAINT RAYMUND NONNATUS(1204-1240) St. Raymund Nonnatus was born in Catalonia in 1204. He was descended of a gentleman's family of small fortune. In his childhood, he seemed to find pleasure only in his devotions and serious duties. His father, perceiving in him an inclination to a religious state, took him from school, and sent him to take care of a farm which he had in the country. Raymund readily obeyed, and, in order to enjoy the opportunity of holy solitude, kept the sheep himself, and spent his time in the mountains and forests in holy meditation and prayer. Some time after, Raymund joined the new Order of Our Lady of Mercy for the redemption of captives, and was admitted to his profession at Barcelona by the holy founder, St. Peter Nolasco. Within 2 or 3 years after his profession, he was sent into Barbary with a considerable sum of money, where he purchased, at Algiers, the liberty of a great number of slaves. When all this treasure was exhausted, he gave himself up as a hostage for the ransom of certain others. This magnanimous sacrifice served only to exasperate the Mohammedans, who treated him barbarously. Raymund almost died in their hands, but they stopped short because he was worth money as a slave. When Raymund was finally permitted to walk on the streets, he stole minutes to comfort and encourage Christians who were in chains. However, after Raymund converted and baptized Muslims, the governor sentenced him to death by impalement. Even though the sentence was commuted, Raymund endured a cruel bastinado. A victim of torture, Raymund was unyeildng. Racked with pain, Raymund summoned the courage to continue exhorting Christian captives and converting Muslims. The governor, livid with rage, ordered him to be tortured and manacled until his ransom was paid. This brutality continued until Raymund's Order bought his freedom. After returning to Spain, Raymund was appointed cardinal by Pope Gregory IX. When the Pope summoned him to Rome, Raymund obeyed, but got no further than Cardona. There, he was seized by a fever and passed away. He went to eternity with Jesus and Mary on August 31, 1240 at the age of thirty-seven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Aristedes()</h3><hr />"
