Then they escorted him to the ship.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>68(67),29-30.33-35a.35b-36c.</em><p>Show forth, O God, your power, <br />the power, O God, with which you took our part;<br />For your temple in Jerusalem <br />let the kings bring you gifts.<br />You kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, <br />chant praise to the Lord<br />who rides on the heights of the ancient heavens. <br />Behold, his voice resounds, the voice of power:<br />\"Confess the power of God!\"<br />Over Israel is his majesty;<br />Awesome is God in his holy place, the God of Israel, <br />who gives power and strength to his people. <br />Blessed be God!</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>17,11b-19.</em><p>Lifting up his eyes to heaven, Jesus prayed, saying: \"Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are.<br />When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me, and I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the son of destruction, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled.<br />But now I am coming to you. I speak this in the world so that they may share my joy completely.<br />I gave them your word, and the world hated them, because they do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world.<br />I do not ask that you take them out of the world but that you keep them from the evil one.<br />They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world.<br />Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth.<br />As you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world.<br />And I consecrate myself for them, so that they also may be consecrated in truth.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Justin(Martyr (+ c. 165) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINT JUSTIN Martyr (+ c. 165) St. Justin was born around 103 AD and raised in a pagan family in Neapolis, Samaria. He was well-educated and studied philosophy to learn the knowledge of God. Justin sought divine knowledge amongst contending schools, but always in vain, till at last God appeased his thirst. One day, while Justin was walking by the seashore, meditating on the thought of God, an old man met him and questioned him on the subject of his doubts. After Justin confessed that the philosophers taught nothing certain about God, the old man told him of the writings of the inspired prophets and of Jesus Christ, and bade him seek light and understanding through prayer. Through prayer, reading Holy Scripture and witnessing the constancy of Christian martyrs, Justin was led from the darkness of strict human reason to the light of faith. In his zeal for the faith, he travelled to Greece, Egypt, and Italy, gaining many to Christ. At Rome, Justin sealed his testimony with his blood. \"Do you think,\" the prefect said to Justin, \"that by dying you will enter heaven and be rewarded by God?\" \"I do not think,\" the Saint answered, \"I know.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Pamphilus(Priest & Martyr (+ 308))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT PAMPHILUS Priest and Martyr (+ 308) St. Pamphilus was a native of Berytus and from a rich and honorable family. In that city, famous for its schools, he excelled in the sciences, and was afterward honored with employment in the magistracy. After beginning to know Christ, Pamphilus could relish no other study than that of salvation, and set aside his privileges to study Holy Scripture. A magistrate and master of sciences, Pamphilus became the scholar of Pierius, the successor of Origen, in the great catechetical school of Alexandria. Pamphilus made CÃ¦sarea in Palestine his residence. At his private expense, he collected a great library and bestowed it on the church of that city. Pamphilus also established a public school of sacred literature. To his labors, the Church was indebted for a correct edition of the Holy Bible, which he transcribed with infinite care. Nothing was more remarkable than Pamphilus' extraordinary humility. Towards his slaves and domestics, his behavior was of a brother or a tender father. He led an austere life, sequestered from the world and its company, and was indefatigable in labor. Eventually, he disolved his paternal estate and distributed it among the poor. Pamphilus' virtues made him accept martyrdom with humility. In the year 307, Urbanus, the governor of Palestine, arrested Pamphilus and had him tortured. The iron hooks which tore Pamphilus' sides could not shake his faith, which confused the judge. Afterward, Pamphilus remained almost two years in prison. Urbanus was himself beheaded by an order of Emperor Maximinus, and was succeeded by Firmilian. After several massacres of Christians, Firmilian summoned St. Pamphilus and passed a death sentence. Pamphilus' flesh was torn off to the very bones, and his bowels exposed to view; and the torments were continued a long time without intermission, but he never once opened his mouth so much as to groan. Pamphilus finished his martyrdom by a slow fire, and died invoking Jesus, the Son of God.</p>"

Then he brought Paul down and made him stand before them.<br />Paul was aware that some were Sadducees and some Pharisees, so he called out before the Sanhedrin, \"My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees; (I) am on trial for hope in the resurrection of the dead.\"<br />When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the group became divided.<br />For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection or angels or spirits, while the Pharisees acknowledge all three.<br />A great uproar occurred, and some scribes belonging to the Pharisee party stood up and sharply argued, \"We find nothing wrong with this man. Suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?\"<br />The dispute was so serious that the commander, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, ordered his troops to go down and rescue him from their midst and take him into the compound.<br />The following night the Lord stood by him and said, \"Take courage. For just as you have borne witness to my cause in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>16(15),1-2a.5.7-8.9-10.11.</em><p>Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;<br />I say to the LORD, \"My Lord are you.\"<br />O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, <br />you it is who hold fast my lot.<br />I bless the LORD who counsels me; <br />even in the night my heart exhorts me.<br />I set the LORD ever before me; <br />with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.<br />Therefore my heart is glad and my soul rejoices, <br />my body, too, abides in confidence<br />because you will not abandon my soul to the netherworld, <br />nor will you suffer your faithful one to undergo corruption.<br />You will show me the path to life, <br />fullness of joys in your presence, <br />the delights at your right hand forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>17,20-26.</em><p>Lifting up his eyes to heaven, Jesus prayed saying: \"I pray not only for them, but also for those who will believe in me through their word,<br />so that they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me.<br />And I have given them the glory you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are one,<br />I in them and you in me, that they may be brought to perfection as one, that the world may know that you sent me, and that you loved them even as you loved me.<br />Father, they are your gift to me. I wish that where I am they also may be with me, that they may see my glory that you gave me, because you loved me before the foundation of the world.<br />Righteous Father, the world also does not know you, but I know you, and they know that you sent me.<br />I made known to them your name and I will make it known, that the love with which you loved me may be in them and I in them.\"</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Peter & Marcellinus(Martyrs (+ c. 304))</h3><p>SAINTS MARCELLINUS, PETER Martyrs (+ c. 304) Pope Damasus received information about the martyrdom of Saints Marcellinus and Peter during the Diocletian persecution from the executioner himself. They were beheaded.The saints are happy in heaven because they followed Christ.They rejoice with him for ever because they shed their blood for love of him.(Entrance antiphon)</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Pothinus(Sanctus, Attalus, Blandina, & the other Martyrs of Lyons (+ 177))</h3><hr /><p>SAINTS POTHINUS, Bishop, SANCTUS, ATTALUS, BLANDINA, and the other Martyrs of Lyons (+ 177) After the miraculous victory obtained by the prayer of Christians under Marcus Aurelius in 174, the Church enjoyed a kind of peace, though it was often disturbed in particular places by popular commotions, or by the superstitious fury of certain governors. This appears from the violent persecution which was raised three years after the aforesaid victory, at Vienne and Lyons in 177, whilst St. Pothinus was Bishop of Lyons and St. IrenÃ¦us, who had been sent thither by St. Polycarp out of Asia, was a priest of that city. Many of the principal Christians were brought before the Roman governor. Among them was a slave, Blandina, and her mistress, also a Christian. They were tormented a whole day through, but they bore it all till the executioners gave up, confessing themselves outdone. Red-hot plates were held to the sides of Sanctus, a deacon of Vienne, till his body became one great sore, and he looked no longer like a man; but in the midst of his tortures, he was \"bedewed and strengthened by the stream of heavenly water which flows from the side of Christ.\" Meantime, many confessors were kept in prison, and with them were some who had been terrified into apostasy. Even the heathens marked the joy of martyrdom in the Christians who were decked for their eternal espousals, and also the misery of the apostates. The faithful confessors brought back those who had fallen away, and the Church, \"that Virgin Mother,\" rejoiced when she saw her children live again in Christ. Some died in prison, the rest were martyred one by one; St. Blandina last of all after seeing her younger brother put to a cruel death, and encouraging him to victory.</p>"

And when he had said this, he said to him, \"Follow me.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Charles Lwanga & his companions()</h3><p>Saint Charles Lwanga and companionsThe 22 Martyrs of Uganda (+ 1886-1887) Charles Lwanga was one of 22 Ugandan martyrs who converted from paganism. Though he was baptized the night before being put to death, he was already a moral leader. He was the chief of the royal pages and was considered the strongest athlete of the court. He was also known as \"the most handsome man of the Kingdom of the Uganda.\" Charles instructed his friends in the Catholic Faith and personally baptized boy pages. He inspired and encouraged his companions to remain chaste and faithful. He protected his companions, ages 13-30, from the immoral acts and homosexual demands of the Babandan ruler, Mwanga. Mwanga was a superstitious king who originally was tolerant of Catholicism. However, his chief assistant, Katikiro, slowly convinced him that Christians were a threat to his rule. The premise was if these Christians would not bow to him, nor make sacrifices to their pagan god, nor pillage, massacre, nor make war, what would happen if his whole kingdom converted to Catholicism? When Charles was sentenced to death, he seemed very peaceful, one might even say, cheerful. He was to be executed by being burnt to death. While the pyre was being prepared, he asked to be untied so that he could arrange the sticks. He then lay down upon them. When the executioner said that Charles would be burned slowly to death, Charles replied by saying that he was very glad to be dying for the True Faith. Charles was burned to death by Mwanga's order on June 3, 1886. He made no cry of pain, but just twisted and moaned, \"Kotanda! (O my God!).\" Pope Paul VI canonized Charles Lwanga and his companions on June 22, 1964. We celebrate his memorial on June 3rd of the Roman Calendar. St. Charles is the Patron of the African Youth of Catholic Action.</p><hr /><h3>St. John XXIII(Pope (1881-1963))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT JOHN XXIII (Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli) Pope (from October 28 1958 to June 3 1963) (1881-1963) Blessed Pope John XXIII was born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli in Sotto il Monte, Diocese of Bergamo on November 25, 1881. He was the fourth in a family of fourteen. The family worked as sharecroppers. It was a patriarchal family in the sense that the families of two brothers lived together, headed by his great-uncle Zaverio, who had never married and whose wisdom guided the work and other business of the family. Zaverio was Angelo's godfather, and to him he always attributed his first and most fundamental religious education. The religious atmosphere of his family and the fervent life of the parish, under the guidance of Fr. Francesco Rebuzzini, provided him with training in the Christian life. He entered the Bergamo seminary in 1892. Here he began the practice of making spiritual notes, which he continued in one form or another until his death, and which have been gathered together in the Journal a Soul. He also began the deeply cherished practice of regular spiritual direction. In 1896, he was admitted to the Secular Franciscan Order by the spiritual director of the Bergamo seminary, Fr. Luigi Isacchi. He made a profession of its Rule of life on May 23, 1897. From 1901 to 1905, he was a student at the Pontifical Roman Seminary. He was ordained in the church of Santa Maria in Monte Santo on August 10, 1904, in Rome's Piazza del Popolo. In 1905, he was appointed secretary to the new Bishop of Bergamo, Giacomo Maria Radini Tedeschi. He accompanied the bishop during pastoral visitations and collaborated with him in many initiatives: a Synod, management of the diocesan bulletin, pilgrimages and social works. In the seminary, he taught history, patrology and apologetics. He was an elegant, profound, effective and sought-after preacher. These were the years of his deepening spiritual encounter with two saints who were outstanding pastors: St. Charles Borromeo and St. Francis de Sales. They were years, too, of deep pastoral involvement and apprenticeship, as he spent every day beside \"his\" Bishop, Radini Tedeschi. When the Bishop passed away in 1914, Fr. Angelo continued to teach in the seminary and to minister in various pastoral areas. When Italy went to war in 1915, he was drafted as a sergeant in the medical corps and became a chaplain to wounded soldiers. When the war ended, he opened a \"Student House\" for the spiritual needs of young people. In 1919, Fr. Angelo was made spiritual director of the seminary, but in 1921, he was called to the service of the Holy See. Benedict XV brought him to Rome to be the Italian president of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. In 1925, Pius XI named him Apostolic Visitator in Bulgaria, raising him to the episcopate with the titular Diocese of Areopolis. For his episcopal motto, Fr. Angelo chose Oboedientia et Pax, \"Obedience and Peace,\" which became his guiding motto for the rest of his life. On March 19, 1925, he was elected bishop and left for Bulgaria. He was granted the title Apostolic Delegate and remained in Bulgaria until 1935, visiting Catholic communities and establishing relationships of respect and esteem with other Christian communities. In the aftermath of the 1928 earthquake, his solicitude was everywhere present. He endured in silence the misunderstandings and other difficulties of a ministry on the fringes of society, and thus refined his sense of trust and abandonment to Jesus crucified. In 1935, he was named Apostolic Delegate in Turkey and Greece. The Catholic Church was present in many ways in the young Turkish republic. His ministry among the Catholics was intense, and his respectful approach and dialogue with the worlds of Orthodoxy and Islam became a feature of his tenure. When the Second World War broke, out he was in Greece. He tried to get news from the prisoners of war to their families and assisted many Jews to escape by issuing \"transit visas\" from the Apostolic Delegation. In December 1944, Pius XII appointed him Nuncio in France. During the last months of the war and the beginning of peace, he aided prisoners of war and helped to normalize the ecclesiastical organization of France. He visited the great shrines of France and participated in popular feasts and in important religious celebrations. He was an attentive, prudent and positive observer of the new pastoral initiatives of the Bishops and clergy of France. His approach was always characterized by striving for Gospel simplicity, even amid the most complex diplomatic questions. The sincere piety of his interior life found expression each day in prolonged periods of prayer and meditation. In 1953, he was elected Cardinal and sent to Venice as Patriarch. He was filled with joy at the prospect of ending his days in the direct care of souls, as he had always desired since becoming a priest. He was a wise and enterprising pastor, following the model pastors he had always venerated and walking in the footsteps of St. Laurence Giustiniani, first Patriarch of Venice. As he advanced in years, his trust in the Lord grew in the midst of energetic, enterprising and joyful pastoral labours. At the death of Pius XII, Cardinal Angelo was elected Pope on October 28, 1958, taking the name John XXIII. His pontificate, which lasted less than five years, presented him to the entire world as an authentic image of the Good Shepherd. Meek and gentle, enterprising and courageous, simple and active, he carried out the Christian duties of the corporal and spiritual works of mercy: visiting the imprisoned and the sick, welcoming those of every nation and faith, and bestowing on all his exquisite fatherly care. His social magisterium in the encyclicals Pacem in Terris and Mater et Magistra were deeply appreciated. Pope John XXIII convoked the Roman Synod, established the Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law and summoned the Second Vatican Council. He was present as Bishop in his Diocese of Rome through his visitation of the parishes, especially those in the new suburbs. The faithful saw in him a reflection of the goodness of God and called him \"the good Pope.\" He was sustained by a profound spirit of prayer. He launched an extensive renewal of the Church, while radiating the peace of one who always trusted in the Lord. Pope John XXIII passed away on the evening of June 3, 1963 in a spirit of profound trust in Jesus and of longing for his embrace. He was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on September 3, 2000 in Rome.(From L'Osservatore Romano, Weekly Edition in English September 6 2000)</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Ignatius Mayolan((1869-1915))</h3><hr /><p>Blessed Ignatius Maloyan Armenian Catholic Archbishop & Martyr (1869-1915) Ignatius Maloyan (Shoukrallah), son of Melkon and FaridÃ©, was born in 1869 in Mardin, Turkey.His parish priest, noticing signs of a priestly vocation, sent him to the convent of Bzommar-Lebanon. He was then fourteen years old. After finishing his superior studies in 1896, the day dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he was ordained in the Church of Bzommar convent, became a member of the Bzommar Institute and adopted the name of Ignatius in remembrance of the famous martyr of Antioch. During the years 1897 to 1910, Father Ignatius was appointed parish priest in Alexandria and Cairo, where his good reputation was widespread. His Beatitude Patriarch Boghos Bedros XII appointed Fr. Ignatius as his assistant in 1904. Because of a disease affecting his eyes and causing difficulty in breathing, Fr. Ignatius returned to Egypt and stayed there until 1910. The Diocese of Mardin being in a state of anarchy, Patriarch Sabbaghian sent Fr. Ignatius Maloyan to restore order.On October 22, 1911, the Synod of Bishops assembled in Rome and elected Fr. Ignatius Archbishop of Mardin. He took over his new assignment and planned on renewing the wrecked Diocese, encouraging especially the devotion to the Sacred Heart. Unfortunately, at the outbreak of the First World War, the Armenians residing in Turkey, then allied with Germany, began to endure unspeakable sufferings. In fact, April 24, 1915 marked the beginning of a veritable campaign of extermination, the Armenian genocide. On April 30, 1915, Turkish soldiers surrounded the Armenian Catholic Bishopric and church in Mardin on the basis that they were hide-outs for arms. At the beginning of May, the Bishop gathered his priests and informed them of the dangerous situation. On June 3, 1915, Turkish soldiers dragged Bishop Maloyan in chains to court with twenty seven other Armenian Catholic personalities. The next day, twenty five priests and eight hundred and sixty two believers were held in chains. During the trial, the chief of the police, Mamdooh Bek, asked the Bishop to convert to Islam. The bishop answered that he would never betray Christ and His Church. Mamdooh Bek hit Bp. Ignatius on the head with the rear of his pistol and ordered him put in jail. The soldiers chained Bp. Ignatius' feet and hands, threw him on the ground and hit him mercilessly. With each blow, the Bishop was heard saying, \"Oh Lord, have mercy on me, oh Lord, give me strength,\" and asked the priests present for absolution. With that, the soldiers went back to hitting him; and they extracted his toe nails. On June 9, Bp. Ignatius' mother visited him and cried for his state. But the valiant Bishop encouraged her. On the next day, the soldiers gathered four hundred and forty seven Armenians. The soldiers, along with the convoys, took the desert route. The bishop encouraged his parishioners to remain firm in their faith. Then all knelt with him. He prayed to God that they accept martyrdom with patience and courage. The priests granted the believers absolution. The Bishop took out a piece of bread, blessed it, recited the words of the Eucharist and gave it to his priests to distribute among the people. One of the soldiers, an eye witness, recounted this scene: \"That hour, I saw a cloud covering the prisoners and from all emitted a perfumed scent. There was a look of joy and serenity on their faces.\" After a two-hour walk, the soldiers attacked the prisoners and killed them before the bishop's eyes. After the massacre of the two convoys came Bp. Ignatius' turn. Mamdooh Bek again asked Bp. Ignatius to convert to Islam. The bishop answered: \"I've told you I shall live and die for Jesus Christ. I take pride in the Cross of my Lord.\" Mamdooh got very angry, drew his pistol and shot Bp. Ignatius. Before he breathed his last, Bp. Ignatius said: \"My God, have mercy on me; into your hands I commend my spirit.\" Bp. Ignatius Mayolan was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on October 7, 2001 in Rome. He reigns with Jesus and the Church Triumphant, interceding on our behalf forever and ever.</p>"

FRANCIS CARACCIOLOPriest and co-founder of the Congregation of the Minor Clerics Regular(1563-1608) St. Francis Caracciolo was born in the kingdom of Naples to a princely family. Preferring to recite the Rosary instead of amusing himself, a young Francis regularly visited the Eucharist and distributed his food among the poor. A sign of deep humility is when Francis contracted leprosy, but was miraculously cured. Fully restored, he left home to study for the priesthood at Naples, where he spent his leisure hours visiting prisoners and adoring the Eucharist in unfrequented churches. Ordained at twenty-five, God showed Fr. Francis his vocation: to found an order of clerics regular. The Order's rule was that one priest fasted on bread and water, another took the discipline, a third wore a hair-shirt, and all three took turns in perpetual Adoration. To add to their usual vows, they also added the refusal of official dignities. On foot and without money, Fr. Francis undertook many journeys through Italy and Spain to establish his Order, subsisting on the crusts given him in charity. Being elected general, he redoubled his austerities and devoted seven hours daily to meditation on the Passion, besides praying for most of the night before the Eucharist, the Treasure of the Church. Fr. Francis was commonly called the Preacher of Divine Love, but it was before the Blessed Sacrament that his ardent devotion was clearly perceptible. In the presence of his divine Lord, Francis' face emitted rays of light. According to his custom, Fr. Francis would lay prostrate before the tabernacle, repeating, \"Zeal for your house has consumed me.\" At age forty-four, Fr. Francis passed away from fever on the eve of Corpus Christi in 1608, saying, \"Let us go, let us go to heaven!\" When his body was opened after death, his heart was found as it were burnt up, and these words imprinted around it: \"Zelus domus TuÃ¦ comedit me\" - \"The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Clotilda(Queen (476-545))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT CLOTILDA Queen (476-545) St. Clotilda was the daughter of Chilperic, a younger brother of Gondebald, the tyrannical King of Burgundy. Gondebald put Chilperic and his wife, and his other brothers, except one to death in order to usurp their dominions. Clotilda was brought up in her uncle's court and providentially instructed in the Catholic faith. She was educated in the midst of Arians. Clotilda's wit, beauty, meekness, modesty and piety made her the adoration of all the neighboring kingdoms, and Clovis I, surnamed the Great, the victorious king of the Franks, demanded and obtained her in marriage. She honored her royal husband, studied to sweeten his warlike temper by Christian meekness, conformed herself to his humor in things that were indifferent, and, the better to gain his affections, made those things the subject of her discourse and praises in which she knew him to take the greatest delight. When she saw herself mistress of his heart, she did not defer the great work of endeavoring to win him to God, but the fear of giving offence to his people made him delay his conversion. His miraculous victory over the Alemanni and his entire conversion in 496 were at length the fruit of our Saint's prayers. Clotilda, having gained to God this great monarch, never ceased to excite him to glorious actions for the divine honor. Among other religious foundations, he built in Paris at her request, about the year 511, the great church of Sts. Peter and Paul, now called St. Genevieve's. This great prince died on November 27, 511 at the age of forty-five, having reigned thirty years. His eldest son, Theodoric, reigned at Rheims over the eastern parts of France, Clodomir reigned at Orleans, Childebert at Paris, and Clotaire I at Soissons. This division produced wars and mutual jealousies, till in 560 the whole monarchy was reunited under Clotaire, the youngest of these brothers. The dissension in her family contributed more perfectly to wean Clotilda's heart from the world. She spent the remaining part of her life in exercises of prayer, almsdeeds, watching, fasting and penance, seeming totally to forget that she had been queen or that her sons sat on the throne. Eternity filled her heart and employed all her thoughts. Clotilda foretold her death thirty days before it happened. On the thirtieth day of her illness, she received the sacraments, made a public confession of her faith, and departed to the Lord on June 4, 545.</p><hr /><h3>St. Kevin()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

BONIFACEBishop, Martyr(+ 754) St. Boniface was born at Crediton in Devonshire, England about the year 673. Some missionaries staying at his father's house spoke to him of heavenly things and inspired him with a wish to devote himself to God. Boniface later entered the monastery of Exminster and trained for apostolic work. His first attempt to convert the pagans in Holland failed, so he went to Rome to obtain the Pope's blessing. He returned with authority to preach to the German tribes. Evangelizing was a slow and dangerous task. Fr. Boniface's life was in constant peril while his flock was often reduced to abject poverty by wandering robber bands. Yet his courage never flagged. He began with Bavaria and Thuringia, next visited Friesland and then passed on to Hesse and Saxony, demolishing idol temples and raising churches on their site. Fr. Boniface endeavored, as far as possible, to make every object of idolatry contribute in some way to the glory of God. On one occasion, having cut down an immense oak used for rituals to Jupiter, he blessed the wood and used it to build a church, which he dedicated to the Prince of the Apostles. He was then recalled to Rome, consecrated Bishop by the Pope, and returned to extend and organize the rising German Church. With diligent care, he reformed abuses among the existing clergy and established religious houses throughout the land. At length, feeling his infirmities increase, and fearful of losing his martyr's crown, Bp. Boniface appointed a successor to his monastery, and set out to convert another pagan tribe. While Bp. Boniface was waiting to administer the sacrament of Confirmation to some newly-baptized Christians, a troop of pagans arrived armed with swords and spears. His attendants would have opposed them, but the Saint said to his followers: \"My children cease your resistance. Scripture forbids us to resist evildoers. Let us put our hope in God; He will save our souls.\" Scarcely had the bishop ceased speaking when the barbarians fell upon him and slew him with all his followers, to the number of fifty-two.</p>"

NORBERTBishop(c.1080-1134) Of noble lineage and rare talents, Norbert experienced a pious upbringing. He entered the ecclesiastical state after coming of age. Residing in the court of Emperor Henry IV, Norbert's calling turned to scandal when he led a life of dissipation and luxury like other clerics. One day, when he was thirty years old, he was thrown half dead from his horse, and on recovering his senses, resolved upon a new life. After a severe and searching preparation, he was ordained and began exposing the abuses of his Order. Silenced at first by a local council, he obtained the pope's sanction and preached penance to listening crowds in France and the Netherlands. In the wild vale of PrÃ©montrÃ©, Fr. Norbert gave some trained disciples the rule of St. Augustine and a white habit to denote the angelic purity proper to the priesthood. The Canons Regular, or Premonstratensians as they were called, united the active work of the country clergy with the obligations of the monastic life. Their fervor renewed the vitality of the priesthood, quickened the faith of the people, and refuted heresy. A heretic named Tankelin appeared at Antwerp denying the reality of the priesthood and blaspheming the Eucharist. Fr. Norbert exposed the usurper and rekindled faith in Jesus' Blessed Sacrament. Many apostates showed contempt for the Blessed Sacrament by burying it in filthy places, but Fr. Norbert compelled them to search for the Sacred Hosts. They found them whole and undamaged, and the Saint bore them back in triumph to the tabernacle. Hence he is generally painted with the monstrance in his hand. In 1126, Fr. Norbert was appointed Bishop of Magdeburg. Risking his own life, he zealously carried out the work of reform. He passed away defending the Church's honor at age fifty-three.</p>"

ROBERT OF NEWMINSTER(12th century) In 1132, Robert was a monk at Whitby, England when news arrived that thirteen religious had been violently expelled from the Abbey of St. Mary in York. They were expelled for proposing to restore strict Benedictine rule. Robert set out to join them and found them living on the banks of the Skeld, in the midst of winter, in a hut made of hurdles and roofed with turf. In the spring, they affiliated themselves to St. Bernard's reform at Clairvaux, and for two years struggled on in extreme poverty. At length, the fame of their sanctity brought another novice, Hugh, Dean of York, who endowed the community with all his wealth, and laid the foundation of Fountains Abbey. In 1137, Raynulph, Baron of Morpeth, was so edified by the example of the monks that he built them a monastery in Northumberland called Newminster, of which Robert became abbot. The holiness of Robert's life, even more than his words, guided his brethren to perfection. Within ten years, three new communities went forth to become centers of holiness in other parts. The abstinence of Robert in refectory alone sufficed to maintain the mortified spirit of the community. One Easter Day, his stomach, weakened by the fast of Lent, could take no food, and he at last consented to eat some bread sweetened with honey. Before it was brought, he felt this relaxation would be a dangerous example, and sent the food untouched to the poor at the gate. The plate was received by a young man of shining countenance who straightaway disappeared. At the next meal, the plate descended empty to the abbot's place in the refectory, proving that what he sacrificed for his brethren had been accepted by Christ. At the moment of Robert's death in 1159, St. Godric, the hermit of Finchale, saw his soul borne up by angels; and as heaven opened, a voice repeated twice, \"Enter now, my friends.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Willibald()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Bl.

Let them choose one, cut it into pieces, and place it on the wood, but start no fire.

MEDARDBishop(c.457-545) Saint Medard was a French prelate in the sixth century famous for being a good shepherd. Born to a pious and noble family in Salency, St. Medard showed compassion toward the poor even as a child. On one occasion, he gave his coat to a destitute blind man. When asked why, he answered that the suffering of Christ's members deeply affected him. Ordained at thirty-three, Fr. Medard zealously performed his duties and tended his flock. His preaching touched hardened hearts while he strained to the heights of sanctity using the Means and by professional study. In 530, the thirteenth bishop of France, Alomer, passed away and St. Medard was unanimously chosen to fill the see. He was consecrated by St. Remigius who had baptized King Clovis in 496. New dignities did not make Bp. Medard abate any of his mortifications and austerities. Though seventy-two at the time, he redoubled his labors for the love of Jesus Christ. His work of replacing idolatry was so successful that the Holy Spirit reigned in the hearts of Celtic people. The conversions occurred amidst perilous and sometimes savage fuedal politics. In 545, with the work in Flanders completed, Bp. Medard returned to Noyon. Shortly after, he fell sick and passed away. His body was buried in his own cathedral, but the many miracles at his tomb moved King Clotaire to transfer the precious relics to Soissons.</p>"

As a young man, he sought out Bishop James and was baptized. Ephrem made such progress in holiness and learning that he was appointed teacher at a flourishing school in Nisibis. Ephrem was ordained as a deacon at the Church of Edessa. He declined the priesthood out of humility, but continually transcended the limits of his spirit. St. Ephrem's writings were so infused with the light of the Holy Spirit that he was considered a Doctor of the Church even while living. He was noted, above all, for his great and tender devotion to the Immaculate Virgin. Full of merits, Ephrem passed away at Edessa in Mesopotamia on the fourteenth of July.

Some they encouraged to persevere; others, who had fallen away, they raised again. Sts. Primus and Felicianus made themselves the servants of all in Christ that all might attain to salvation through Him. Their zeal was remarkable, and they were spared the dangers of many bloody persecutions well into old age. The brothers practiced heroic virtue up to the final test. The pagans raised an outcry against Primus and Felicianus, having them arrested and imprisoned. The brothers were scourged and sent to a town twelve miles from Rome for torture. Once there, they were tortured together and afterward separately. \"But where sin increased, grace increased all the more\" (Rom. 5:20). The brothers were beheaded on the 9th of June, earning crowns of martyrdom and reigning with Jesus Christ forever.</p>"

She built churches and monasteries, busied herself in making vestments and could not rest till she saw the laws of God and His Church observed throughout her realm. Next, Margaret made time to converse with God. She ordered her piety with such sweetness and discretion that she won her husband to sanctity. He would rise with her at night for prayer, kissed the holy books she read and sometimes returned them covered with jewels. Margaret exhibited contrition for her sins and sought help from her spiritual director and confessor. She was also an exemplary mother, responsibly fulfilling her duties out of love. She spared no pains in the education of her eight children, and their sanctity was the fruit of her prudence and her zeal. Margaret was her husband's most trusted counselor, and she labored ceaselessly for the material improvement of the country. In the midst of the world, Margaret sighed for a better country, and welcomed death with the courage and fortitude of the saints. Shortly before her passing, she received news that her husband and eldest son were slain in battle. Margaret nonetheless thanked God and blessed His Holy Name. After receiving Holy Viaticum, Margaret repeated the prayer from the Missal, \"O Lord Jesus Christ, Who by Thy death gave life to the world, deliver me.\" At the words \"deliver me,\" says her biographer, she took her departure to Christ, the Author of Life.</p><hr /><h3>St. Getulius & Comp.()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>St. Ithamar()</h3><hr />"

And a large number of people was added to the Lord.<br />Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul,<br />and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large number of people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.<br />Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Symeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who was a close friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.<br />While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the holy Spirit said, \"Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.\"<br />Then, completing their fasting and prayer, they laid hands on them and sent them off.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>98(97),1.2-3ab.3cd-4.5-6.</em><p>Sing to the LORD a new song, <br />for he has done wondrous deeds; <br />His right hand has won victory for him, <br />his holy arm.<br />The LORD has made his salvation known: <br />in the sight of the nations he has revealed his justice.<br />He has remembered his kindness and his faithfulness<br />toward the house of Israel.<br />All the ends of the earth have seen<br />the salvation by our God.<br />Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands; <br />break into song; sing praise.<br />Sing praise to the LORD with the harp, <br />with the harp and melodious song.<br />With trumpets and the sound of the horn <br />sing joyfully before the King, the LORD.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>10,7-13.</em><p>Jesus said to his Apostles: âAs you go, make this proclamation: 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'<br />Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. Without cost you have received; without cost you are to give.\"<br />Do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts;<br />no sack for the journey, or a second tunic, or sandals, or walking stick.

There, he perceived the great work which was to be done among the Greeks, so he hastened to fetch St. Paul from his retirement at Tarsus. It was at Antioch that the Saints opened Jesus' salvation to the Gentiles. Setting out together, they preached in Cyprus and the cities of Asia Minor. Their preaching struck men with amazement. The Gospel author Luke records that when Paul and Barnabas worked a miracle, some cried out, \"The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men,\" calling Paul Mercury and Barnabas Jupiter. The Saints travelled together to the Council of Jerusalem, but shortly after this they parted. When Agabus prophesied a great famine, Barnabas, no longer rich, was chosen by the faithful at Antioch as most fit to bear, with St. Paul, their generous offerings to the Church of Jerusalem. The gentle Barnabas, keeping with him John, surnamed Mark, whom St. Paul distrusted, betook himself to Cyprus. Sacred history leaves him at Cyprus; and here, at a later period, he won his martyr's crown.</p>"

FAGONDEZPriest(+1479) St. John was born at St. Fagondez in Spain. At an early age, he held several benefices in the diocese of Burgos. At last, the reproaches of his conscience forced him to resign them all except one chapel, where he said Mass daily, preached and catechised. After resigning his benefices, St. John studied theology at Salamanca and then labored for some time as a most devoted missionary priest. Ultimately, he became a hermit of the Augustinian Order in the same city. St. John's life was marked by a singular devotion to the Holy Mass. Each night after Matins, he remained in prayer till offering the Eucharist with tender piety. St. John's personal holiness was also seen in his preaching, which produced a reformation in Salamanca. He had a special gift of reconciling differences and was enabled to put an end to the quarrels and feuds among noblemen, which were common and often fatal at the time. St. John's boldness in reproving vice also endangered his life. A powerful nobleman sent two assasins to kill St. John after being corrected for oppressing vassals. The Saint's holiness and peace of soul struck such awe into the assassins that they could not execute their purpose, and instead begged forgiveness. The nobleman, falling sick, was brought to repentance and recovered his health by the prayers of the Saint. St. John zealously denounced the vices which are a fruitful source of strife, and it was in defence of holy purity that he met his death. A lady of noble birth but evil life, whose companion in sin St. John had converted, contrived to administer a fatal poison to the Saint. After months of terrible suffering borne with unwavering patience, St. John went to eternity with God on June 11, 1479.</p><hr /><h3>St. Leo III()</h3><hr />"

I will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or, if you prefer, I will give you its value in money.\"<br />\"The LORD forbid,\" Naboth answered him, \"that I should give you my ancestral heritage.\"<br />Ahab went home disturbed and angry at the answer Naboth the Jezreelite had made to him: \"I will not give you my ancestral heritage.\" Lying down on his bed, he turned away from food and would not eat.<br />His wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, \"Why are you so angry that you will not eat?\"<br />He answered her, \"Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Sell me your vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in exchange.' But he refused to let me have his vineyard.\"<br />\"A fine ruler over Israel you are indeed!\" his wife Jezebel said to him. \"Get up. Eat and be cheerful. I will obtain the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite for you.\"<br />So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and, having sealed them with his seal, sent them to the elders and to the nobles who lived in the same city with Naboth.<br />This is what she wrote in the letters: \"Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.<br />Next, get two scoundrels to face him and accuse him of having cursed God and king. Then take him out and stone him to death.\"<br />His fellow citizens--the elders and the nobles who dwelt in his city--did as Jezebel had ordered them in writing, through the letters she had sent them.<br />They proclaimed a fast and placed Naboth at the head of the people.<br />Two scoundrels came in and confronted him with the accusation, \"Naboth has cursed God and king.\" And they led him out of the city and stoned him to death.<br />Then they sent the information to Jezebel that Naboth had been stoned to death.<br />When Jezebel learned that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, \"Go on, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite which he refused to sell you, because Naboth is not alive, but dead.\"<br />On hearing that Naboth was dead, Ahab started off on his way down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>5,2-3ab.4b-6a.6b-7.</em><p>Hearken to my words, O LORD, <br />Attend to my sighing.<br />Heed my call for help,<br />My king and my God!<br />At dawn I bring my plea expectantly before you.<br />For you, O God, delight not in wickedness; <br />no evil man remains with you;<br />the arrogant may not stand in your sight.<br />You hate all evildoers.<br />You destroy all who speak falsehood; <br />the bloodthirsty and the deceitful <br />the LORD abhors.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>5,38-42.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.<br />But I say to you, offer no resistance to one who is evil.

When the others dispersed, there lingered behind, unknown and overlooked, a poor Portuguese friar who resolved to ask for and to refuse nothing. Nine months later, Fra Antonio rose under obedience to preach to the religious assembled at Forli. As the discourse proceeded, \"the Ark of the Testament,\" \"the eldest son of St. Francis\" stood revealed in all his sanctity, learning, and eloquence before his rapt and astonished brethren. Committed from earliest youth to prayer, devotions and study among the Canons Regular, Ferdinand de Bulloens, as his name was in the world, had been stirred by the spirit and example of the first five Franciscan martyrs who put on their habit and preached the Faith to the Moors in Africa. Denied a martyr's palm and enfeebled by sickness at the age of twenty-seven, he was taking upon himself the humblest offices in his community. From this school, he was called forth, and for nine years, France, Italy and Sicily heard his voice and saw his miracles, turning the hearts of men toward God. One night, when St. Antony was staying with a friend in the city of Padua, his host saw brilliant rays streaming under the door of the Saint's room. On looking through the keyhole, he beheld a little Child of marvellous beauty standing upon a book which lay open upon the table, and clinging with both arms round Antony's neck. With an ineffable sweetness, he watched the tender caresses of the Saint and his wondrous Visitor. At last, the Child vanished, and Fra Antonio, opening the door, charged his friend, by the love of Him whom he had seen, to \"tell the vision to no man\" as long as he was alive. Suddenly, in 1231, our Saint's brief apostolate was closed. The voices of children were heard crying along the streets of Padua, \"Our father, St. Antony, is dead.\" The following year, the church-bells of Lisbon rang without ringers, while at Rome one of its sons was inscribed among the Saints of God.</p>"

He will be in the vineyard of Naboth, of which he has come to take possession.<br />This is what you shall tell him, 'The LORD says: After murdering, do you also take possession? For this, the LORD says: In the place where the dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, the dogs shall lick up your blood, too.'\"<br />\"Have you found me out, my enemy?\" Ahab said to Elijah. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"Because you have given yourself up to doing evil in the LORD'S sight,<br />I am bringing evil upon you: I will destroy you and will cut off every male in Ahab's line, whether slave or freeman, in Israel.<br />I will make your house like that of Jeroboam, son of Nebat, and like that of Baasha, son of Ahijah, because of how you have provoked me by leading Israel into sin.\"<br />(Against Jezebel, too, the LORD declared, \"The dogs shall devour Jezebel in the district of Jezreel.\")<br />\"When one of Ahab's line dies in the city, dogs will devour him; when one of them dies in the field, the birds of the sky will devour him.\"<br />Indeed, no one gave himself up to the doing of evil in the sight of the LORD as did Ahab, urged on by his wife Jezebel.<br />He became completely abominable by following idols, just as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD drove out before the Israelites.<br />When Ahab heard these words, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth over his bare flesh. He fasted, slept in the sackcloth, and went about subdued.<br />Then the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite,<br />\"Have you seen that Ahab has humbled himself before me? Since he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his time. I will bring the evil upon his house during the reign of his son.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>51(50),3-4.5-6ab.11.16.</em><p>Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; <br />in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.<br />Thoroughly wash me from my guilt <br />and of my sin cleanse me.<br />For I acknowledge my offense, <br />and my sin is before me always:<br />\"Against you only have I sinned,<br />and done what is evil in your sight.\"<br />Turn away your face from my sins, <br />and blot out all my guilt.<br />Free me from blood guilt, O God, my saving God; <br />then my tongue shall revel in your justice.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>5,43-48.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.<br />But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,<br />that you may be children of your heavenly Father, for he makes his sun rise on the bad and the good, and causes rain to fall on the just and the unjust.<br />For if you love those who love you, what recompense will you have?

He was called by the prophet Elijah while plowing his father's fields. Elijah cast his mantle upon Elisha conferring succession. Before Elijah was taken up in a fiery chariot and into the whirlwind, Elisha asked to \"inherit a double-portion\" of Elijah's spirit. With authority from succession, Elisha performed many miracles during his life. Elisha's first miracle was restoring the farmland in the town of Jericho. He added salt to its spring and purified the waters. When the armies of Judah, Israel and Edom, then allied against Mesa the Moabite king, were being tormented by drought in the IdumÃ¦an desert, Elisha intervened. His prophecy regarding relief from drought and victory over the Moabites was fulfilled the following morning (2 Kgs 3:4-24). To relieve a widow importuned by a hard creditor, Elisha multiplied a little oil, which not only paid her debts, but also provided for her family's needs (2 Kgs 4:1-7). To reward the rich lady of Shunam for her hospitality, he raised her dead son to life (2 Kgs 4:18-37). To nourish the sons of the prophets pressed by famine, Elisha changed pottage made from poisonous gourds into wholesome food (2 Kgs 4:38-41). During the military incursions of Syria into Israel, Elisha cured Naaman the Syrian's leprosy by sending him to bathe in the Jordan seven times. Reluctant at first, Naaman obeyed, washed seven times and was cured. Jesus referred to this when he said: \"And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian\" (Luke 4:27). Elisha's life and activities are found in 1 and 2 Kings and he is commemorated on this date in the 2004 Roman Martyrology.</p>"

When he was young, he showed innocence of life, modesty and love of prayer. When he turned eighteen, he entered the Society of Jesus. After graduating, he gave himself entirely to the salvation of souls. Fr. John spent the winter in country missions, principally in mountainous districts. In spite of harsh weather and the people's roughness, he gained innumerable souls to Christ. They converted from heresy and immoral acts thanks to his prayers, penances, mortifications, works and preaching. In the summer, Fr. John visited hospitals and prisons, preaching and instructing, and assisting all in need. In works of mercy, God helped St. John by miracles.In November 1637, Fr. John set out for his second mission at Marthes, crossing snow-filled valleys and frozen and precipitous mountains. When climbing a mountain, a bush he was clinging to gave way, and he broke his leg in the fall. With his companion's help, he covered the remaining six miles, but instead of seeing a surgeon, went to hear confessions. After several hours, the curate of the parish found him, with his leg miraculously healed. St. John's apostolate was among the poor and marginalized. He established halfway houses for abused and exploited women. He solicited donations from wealthy French families to build shelters and finance vocational training for the needy.Like a good shepherd, he prioritized the needs of his flock, especially the weakest and most in need. His apostolate was so fruitful that conversions followed everywhere. \"Goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever\" (Ps. 23:6). St. John was ablaze with the love of God, and he offered up the Holy Eucharist with such attentiveness and humility that those who assisted sensed something of that fire. After twelve years of unceasing labor, Fr. John rendered his pure soul to Jesus Christ at the age of forty-four.</p>"

She concealed him from Athaliah, and so he did not die.<br />For six years he remained hidden in the temple of the LORD, while Athaliah ruled the land.<br />But in the seventh year, Jehoiada summoned the captains of the Carians and of the guards. He had them come to him in the temple of the LORD, exacted from them a sworn commitment, and then showed them the king's son.<br />The captains did just as Jehoiada the priest commanded. Each one with his men, both those going on duty for the sabbath and those going off duty that week, came to Jehoiada the priest.<br />He gave the captains King David's spears and shields, which were in the temple of the LORD.<br />And the guards, with drawn weapons, lined up from the southern to the northern limit of the enclosure, surrounding the altar and the temple on the king's behalf.<br />Then Jehoiada led out the king's son and put the crown and the insignia upon him. They proclaimed him king and anointed him, clapping their hands and shouting, \"Long live the king!\"<br />Athaliah heard the noise made by the people, and appeared before them in the temple of the LORD.<br />When she saw the king standing by the pillar, as was the custom, and the captains and trumpeters near him, with all the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets, she tore her garments and cried out, \"Treason, treason!\"<br />Then Jehoiada the priest instructed the captains in command of the force: \"Bring her outside through the ranks. If anyone follows her,\" he added, \"let him die by the sword.\" He had given orders that she should not be slain in the temple of the LORD.<br />She was led out forcibly to the horse gate of the royal palace, where she was put to death.<br />Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD as one party and the king and the people as the other, by which they would be the LORD'S people; and another covenant, between the king and the people.<br />Thereupon all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and demolished it. They shattered its altars and images completely, and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. After appointing a detachment for the temple of the LORD, Jehoiada<br />All the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet, now that Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the royal palace.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>132(131),11.12.13-14.17-18.</em><p>The LORD swore to David <br />a firm promise from which he will not withdraw: <br />\"Your own offspring <br />I will set upon your throne.\"<br />\"If your sons keep my covenant <br />and the decrees which I shall teach them, <br />their sons, too, forever <br />shall sit upon your throne.\"<br />For the LORD has chosen Zion; <br />He prefers her for his dwelling.<br />\"Zion is my resting place forever; <br />In her will I dwell, for I prefer her.\"<br />\"In her will I make a horn to sprout forth for David; <br />I will place a lamp for my anointed.<br />his enemies I will clothe with shame, <br />but upon him my crown shall shine.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>6,19-23.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and decay destroy, and thieves break in and steal.<br />But store up treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor decay destroys, nor thieves break in and steal.<br />For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.<br />The lamp of the body is the eye. If your eye is sound, your whole body will be filled with light;<br />but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be in darkness. And if the light in you is darkness, how great will the darkness be.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Herve(Abbot, (6th century))</h3><p>Saint Herve of BrittanyAbbot(6th century) Saint Herve, sometimes called Harvey or Hervues, is venerated throughout Brittany. We have few particulars on him because his life was not written until the late medieval period. All we really know is that he was a hermit in Brittany, where he is still venerated. Herve was the son of the bard Hyvarnion and was born blind. His father died when he was an infant and he was raised by his uncles after his mother became an anchoress.He lived for a while as a hermit and bard and then joined a monastic school at Plouvien which had been founded by his uncle. After becoming Abbot of Plouvien, he built an abbey at Lanhourneau. St. Herve is venerated as a miracle worker. He is reported to have a special ministry of healing animals and to have a domesticated wolf as a companion.He is invoked against eye trouble and he is depicted with a wolf.</p><hr /><h3>St. Avitus(Abbot)</h3><hr /><p>SAINT AVITUSAbbot St. Avitus was a native of Orleans who took the monastic habit with St. Calais in the abbey of Menat in Auvergne. Although small, the abbey was later endowned by Queen Brunehault and St. Boner, Bishop of Clermont. Avitus and Calais returned to Miscy, situated a league and a half below Orleans. It was founded toward the end of the reign of Clovis I by St. Euspicius, a holy priest, and his nephew, St. Maximin or Mesnim. EitherSt. Maximin or St. Euspicius was the first abbot, while St. Avitus the third. At present, the abbey is named after St. Maximin and is administered by the Cistercians. St. Avitus and St. Calais later moved to Dunois on the frontiers of La Perche searching for a closer retirement. When others joined them,St. Calais retired to a forest in Maine. King Clotaire then built a church and monastery for St. Avitus and his companions. The monastery is today a Benedictine convent called St. Avy of Chateaudun in the diocese of Chartres. It is situated on the Loire at the foot of the hill on which the town of Chateaudun is built. Three famous monks, Leobin, Euphronius and Rusticus attended Fra Avitus to his happy death about the year 530. His body was carried to Orleans and reverently interred in that city.</p><hr /><h3>Sts.

He took his stand above the people and said to them: \"God says, 'Why are you transgressing the LORD'S commands, so that you cannot prosper? Because you have abandoned the LORD, he has abandoned you.'\"<br />But they conspired against him, and at the king's order they stoned him to death in the court of the LORD'S temple.<br />Thus King Joash was unmindful of the devotion shown him by Jehoiada, Zechariah's father, and slew his son. And as he was dying, he said, \"May the LORD see and avenge.\"<br />At the turn of the year a force of Arameans came up against Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem, did away with all the princes of the people, and sent all their spoil to the king of Damascus.<br />Though the Aramean force came with few men, the LORD surrendered a very large force into their power, because Judah had abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers. So punishment was meted out to Joash.<br />After the Arameans had departed from him, leaving him in grievous suffering, his servants conspired against him because of the murder of the son of Jehoiada the priest. They killed him on his sickbed. He was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>89(88),4-5.29-30.31-32.33-34.</em><p>\"I have made a covenant with my chosen one, <br />I have sworn to David my servant:<br />Forever will I confirm your posterity <br />and establish your throne for all generations.â<br />Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him, <br />and my covenant with him stands firm.â<br />I will make his posterity endure forever <br />and his throne as the days of heaven.\"<br />\"If his sons forsake my law <br />and walk not according to my ordinances,<br />If they violate my statutes <br />and keep not my commands.\"<br />\"I will punish their crime with a rod <br />and their guilt with stripes.<br />Yet my mercy I will not take from him, <br />nor will I belie my faithfulness.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>6,24-34.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"No one can serve two masters. He will either hate one and love the other, or be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.<br />Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat (or drink), or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?<br />Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you more important than they?<br />Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?<br />Why are you anxious about clothes? Learn from the way the wild flowers grow. They do not work or spin.<br />But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.<br />If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith?<br />So do not worry and say, 'What are we to eat?' or 'What are we to drink?' or 'What are we to wear?'<br />All these things the pagans seek. Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.<br />But seek first the kingdom (of God) and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.<br />Do not worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself. Sufficient for a day is its own evil.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Gregory Barbarigo(Bishop (1625-1697))</h3><p>SAINT GREGORY BARBARIGOBishop (1625-1697) Gregory Barbarigo was born to a noble family in Venice and graduated with high honors from the University of Padua with doctorates in canon and civil law. With the encouragement of Fabio Chigi, the Apostolic Nuncio, he attended the Peace Congress in MÃ¼nster when he was nineteen. There, Gregory consecrated himself to the service of the Church. After Gregory was ordained, Fabio Chigi became Pope Alexander VII. He nominated Gregory to the Bishopric of Bergamo and appointed him cardinal. Gregory was afterward transferred to the Bishopric of Padua. While carrying out his duties, Bp. Gregory emulated St. Charles Borromeo. He zealously put into effect the admonitions and decrees of the Council of Trent. Pastoral by nature, Bp. Gregory preached about uprooting vice and cultivating virtue.He took special pains to promote catechetical instruction and visited every village of his diocese, teaching and encouraging wherever he went. Bp. Gregory enlarged the seminaries of both Bergamo and Padua. He built a library in Padua and a printing press to reach people in the Near East in their own language. His works of charity were remarkable in that he always provided for the needs of the poor,selling his furniture, clothes and even his bed to help them. After a short illness, Bp. Gregory passed away on June 15, 1697. Reknowned for his virtues, he was beatified by Clement XIII and added to the list of saints by John XXIII.</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Marcus and Marcellianus(Martyrs (+286))</h3><hr /><p>SAINTS MARCUS and MARCELLIANUSMartyrs(+286) Marcus and Marcellianus were twin brothers from a noble family in Rome. They converted to the Faith in their youth and were honorably married. Diocletian ascending the imperial throne in 284, the pagans surrounding him raised a persecution. The brothers were thrown into prison and condemned to be beheaded. Their friends obtained a respite of the execution for thirty days and attempted to have them worship false gods. Tranquillinus and Martia, their unbelieving parents, in company with their sons' wives and babies, endeavored to move them by tender entreaties and tears. St. Sebastian, an officer of the emperor's household, came to Rome soon after the brothers were imprisoned and encouraged them. The result of all these interactions was the happy conversion of the father, mother and wives, and also of Nicostratus, the public register, and soon after of Chromatius, the judge, who set the Saints at liberty, and, abdicating the magistracy, retired into the country. Marcus and Marcellianus were concealed by a Christian officer in his apartments in the palace, but they were betrayed by an apostate and retaken. Fabian, who had succeeded Chromatius, condemned them to be bound to two pillars with their feet nailed to the same. In this posture, they remained a day and a night, and on the following day were stabbed with lances.</p><hr /><h3>St. Elizabeth of Schoenau()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Do this in remembrance of me.\"<br />In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"<br />For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>9,11b-17.</em><p>Jesus spoke to the crowds about the kingdom of God, and he healed those who needed to be cured.<br />As the day was drawing to a close, the Twelve approached him and said, \"Dismiss the crowd so that they can go to the surrounding villages and farms and find lodging and provisions; for we are in a deserted place here.\"<br />He said to them, \"Give them some food yourselves.\" They replied, \"Five loaves and two fish are all we have, unless we ourselves go and buy food for all these people.\"<br />Now the men there numbered about five thousand. Then he said to his disciples, \"Have them sit down in groups of (about) fifty.\"<br />They did so and made them all sit down.<br />Then taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he said the blessing over them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.<br />They all ate and were satisfied. And when the leftover fragments were picked up, they filled twelve wicker baskets.</p><hr /><h3>St. Juliana Falconieri (1270-1340)()</h3><p>SAINT JULIANA FALCONIERI(1270-1340) St. Juliana Falconieri was born in answer to prayer in 1270. Her father built the splendid church of the Annunziata in Florence, while her uncle, Blessed Alexius, became one of the founders of the Servite Order. Under his care, Juliana grew up, as he said, more like an angel than a human being. Such was her modesty that she never used a mirror or gazed upon a man's face. The mere mention of sin made her shudder, and once hearing a scandal through gossip, she fell into a swoon. Juliana's devotion to the sorrows of Our Lady drew her to the Servants of Mary. At the age of fourteen, she refused an offer of marriage and received the habit from St. Philip Benizi. Her sanctity attracted many novices, for whose direction she was bidden to draw up a rule; and thus became foundress of the \"Mantellate.\" She was with her children as their servant rather than their mistress. Outside her convent, she led a life of apostolic charity: converting sinners, reconciling enemies and healing the sick. Sr. Juliana was sometimes rapt for days in ecstasy; and her prayers saved the Servite Order when it was in danger of being suppressed. She was visited in her last hour by angels in the form of white doves, and Jesus Himself, as a beautiful child, crowned her with a garland of flowers. She passed away from a stomach disease that prevented her from eating. She endured her constant agony through cheerfulness, grieving only for the privation of Holy Communion. When in her seventieth year, near the point of death, she asked to see and adore the Blessed Sacrament. It was brought to her cell and reverently laid on a corporal, which was placed over her heart. At this moment she expired, and the Sacred Host disappeared. After her death the form of the Host was found stamped upon her heart in the exact spot over which the Blessed Sacrament had been placed.</p><hr /><h3>St. Romuald(Abbot (c. 952-1027))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ROMUALD Abbot (c. 952-1027) In his youth, St. Romuald was troubled by temptations of the flesh. To escape them, he had recourse to hunting, and in the woods first conceived his love for solitude. In 976, Sergius, his father, a nobleman of Ravenna, quarrelled with a relative about an estate and slew him in a duel. Romuald, horrified at his father's deed, entered the Benedictine monastery at Classe for a forty days' penance. This penance ended in his own vocation to religion. After three years at Classe, some bad example of his fellow monks induced Romuald to depart and live as a hermit near Venice. There, he was joined by Peter Urseolus, Duke of Venice, who sought redemption after usurping power. Together, they led an austere and penetential life, and were frequently assaulted by fallen angels. St. Romuald founded many monasteries, the chief of which was at Camaldoli, a wild desert place, where he built a church surrounded by separate cells for the solitaries under his rule. His disciples were hence called Camaldolese. He is said to have seen a vision of a mystic ladder and his white-clothed monks ascending by it to heaven. Among his first disciples were Sts. Adalbert and Boniface, apostles of Russia, and Sts. John and Benedict of Poland, martyrs for the faith. He was an intimate friend of the Emperor St. Henry, and was reverenced and consulted by many great men of his time. If there was a saint of the silver lining, it would be St. Romuald. He discovered his vocation after his father's act of revenge and the temptations besetting him. The scandal of some monks at Classe brought him Urseolus, his first disciple, whom he reformed. Finally, the persecutions of others made him settle in Camaldoli and found a new order. Romuald passed away as he had foretold twenty years earlier: alone, in his monastery of Val Castro, on the 19th of June 1027.</p>"

In retaliation, Theodora sent Vigilius, an archdeacon, to depose the Pope. Vigilius paid a Roman general, Belisarius, to remove Pope Silverius and instate 3 schismatic Patriarchs: Anthimus of Constantinople, Severus of Antioch and Theodosius of Alexandria. Accused of treason and conspiring to aid the Goths, Pope Silverius was banished to Patara in Lycia. The bishop of that city, undertaking his defence, spoke boldly to the Emperor at Constantinople, \"There are many kings in the world, but only one Pope over the Church of the whole world.\" Startled, Emperor Justinian ordered St. Silverius to be sent back to Rome. Pope Silverius' enemies conspired to prevent his rightful reinstatement. He was kidnapped on his way to Rome and abandoned on a desert island, where he died on June 20, 538.</p><hr /><h3>St. Alban(Julius and Aaron)</h3><hr />"

His first words were the names of Jesus and Mary. When he was nine, he made a vow of perpetual virginity, and by a special grace was exempted from temptations against purity. He received his first Communion from St. Charles Borromeo. After Aloysius resolved to leave the world, he saw our Lady in a vision directing him to join the Society of Jesus. The Saint's mother rejoiced, but his father refused for three years. Once Aloysius obtained permission, he entered the novitiate on the 25th of November 1585. He took his vows after two years and completed courses in philosophy and theology. Aloysius said that he doubted grace could make headway against nature without penance and sensory mortifications. Nature tends to relapse into its old state when not mortified or penance made for sins. \"Always give the body a little less than it asks.\" \"I am a crooked piece of iron,\" Aloysius said, \"but penance and mortifications will straighten me.\" During his last year of theology, a malignant fever broke out in Rome. Aloysius offered himself for the service of the sick and was accepted for the dangerous duty. Several of the brothers caught the fever and Aloysius was brought to the point of death. Even though he recovered, a slow fever carried him off after three months. He died a little after midnight between the 20th and 21st of June, on the octave-day of Corpus Christi, being twenty-fourth years old.

Whenever men or women heed the call of truth, their conscience then guides their actions reliably towards good. Precisely because of the witness which he bore, even at the price of his life, to the primacy of truth over power, Saint Thomas More is venerated as an imperishable example of moral integrity. And even outside the Church, particularly among those with responsibility for the destinies of peoples, he is acknowledged as a source of inspiration for a political system which has as its supreme goal the service of the human person. Thomas More had a remarkable political career in his native land. Born in London in 1478 of a respectable family, as a young boy he was placed in the service of the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Morton, Lord Chancellor of the Realm. He then studied law at Oxford and London, while broadening his interests in the spheres of culture, theology and classical literature. He mastered Greek and enjoyed the company and friendship of important figures of Renaissance culture, including Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. His sincere religious sentiment led him to pursue virtue through the assiduous practice of asceticism: he cultivated friendly relations with the Observant Franciscans of the Friary at Greenwich, and for a time he lived at the London Charterhouse, these being two of the main centres of religious fervour in the Kingdom. Feeling himself called to marriage, family life and dedication as a layman, in 1505 he married Jane Colt, who bore him four children. Jane died in 1511 and Thomas then married Alice Middleton, a widow with one daughter. Throughout his life, St. Thomas was an affectionate and faithful husband and father, deeply involved in his children's religious, moral and intellectual education. His house offered a welcome to his children's spouses and his grandchildren, and was always open to his many young friends in search of the truth or of their own calling in life. Family life also gave him ample opportunity for prayer in common and lectio divina, as well as for happy and wholesome relaxation. Thomas attended daily Mass in the parish church, but the austere penances which he practised were known only to his immediate family. He was elected to Parliament for the first time in 1504 under King Henry VII. The latter's successor Henry VIII renewed his mandate in 1510, and even made him the Crown's representative in the capital. This launched him on a prominent career in public administration. During the following decade, the King sent him on several diplomatic and commercial missions to Flanders and the territory of present-day France. Having been made a member of the King's Council, presiding judge of an important tribunal, deputy treasurer and a knight, in 1523 he became Speaker of the House of Commons. Highly esteemed by everyone for his unfailing moral integrity, sharpness of mind, his open and humorous character, and his extraordinary learning, in 1529, at a time of political and economic crisis in the country, he was appointed by the King to the post of Lord Chancellor. The first layman to occupy this position, Thomas faced an extremely difficult period, as he sought to serve King and country. In fidelity to his principles, he concentrated on promoting justice and restraining the harmful influence of those who advanced their own interests at the expense of the weak. In 1532, not wishing to support Henry VIII's intention to take control of the Church in England, he resigned. He withdrew from public life, resigning himself to suffering poverty with his family and being deserted by many people who, in the moment of trial, proved to be false friends. Given his inflexible firmness in rejecting any compromise with his own conscience, in 1534 the King had him imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was subjected to various kinds of psychological pressure. Thomas More did not allow himself to waver, and he refused to take the oath requested of him, since this would have involved accepting a political and ecclesiastical arrangement that prepared the way for uncontrolled despotism. At his trial, he made an impassioned defence of his own convictions on the indissolubility of marriage, the respect due to the juridical patrimony of Christian civilization, and the freedom of the Church in her relations with the State. Condemned by the Court, he was beheaded. Thomas More, together with 53 other martyrs, including Bishop John Fisher, was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886. And with John Fisher, he was canonized by Pius XI in 1935, on the fourth centenary of his martyrdom. The life of Saint Thomas More clearly illustrates a fundamental truth of political ethics. The defence of the Church's freedom from unwarranted interference by the State is at the same time a defence, in the name of the primacy of conscience, of the individual's freedom vis-Ã¡-vis political power. Here we find the basic principle of every civil order consonant with human nature. Therefore, after due consideration and willingly acceding to the petitions addressed to me, I establish and declare Saint Thomas More the heavenly Patron of Statesmen and Politicians, and I decree that he be ascribed all the liturgical honours and privileges which, according to law, belong to the Patrons of categories of people.(St. John Paul II - Apostolic letter issued Motu Proprio proclaiming Saint Thomas More Patron of Statesmen and Politicians - October 31, 2000)</p><hr /><h3>St. John Fisher(Bishop and Martyr (1459-1535))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT JOHN FISHERBishop and Martyr(1459-1535) St. John Fisher was born in Beverly, Yorkshire and educated at Cambridge, from which he received his Master of Arts in 1491. He occupied the vicarage of Northallerton from 1491 to 1494 and then became proctor of Cambridge University. In 1497, he was appointed confessor to Lady Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII, and became closely associated in her endowments to Cambridge. He created scholarships, introduced Greek and Hebrew into the curriculum, and brought in the world-famous Erasmus as professor of Divinity and Greek. In 1504, John Fisher became Bishop of Rochester and Chancellor of Cambridge, in which capacity he also tutored Prince Henry who was to become Henry VIII. Bp. John was dedicated to the welfare of his diocese and his university. From 1527, he steadfastly resisted the encroachment of Henry on the Church and actively opposed the King's divorce proceedings against Catherine, his wife in the sight of God. Unlike the other Bishops, St. John refused to take the oath of succession which acknowledged the issue of Henry and Anne as the legitimate heir to the throne, and he was imprisoned in the tower in April 1534. The next year, he was made a Cardinal by Paul III and Henry retaliated by having him beheaded within a month. A half hour before his execution, this dedicated scholar and churchman opened his New Testament for the last time and his eyes fell on the following words from St. John's Gospel: \"Eternal life is this: to know You, the only true God, and Him Whom You have sent, Jesus Christ. I have given you glory on earth by finishing the work you gave me to do. Do you now, Father, give me glory at your side.\" Closing the book, he observed: \"There is enough learning in that to last me the rest of my life.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Paulinus of Nola(Bishop (353-431))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT PAULINUS OF NOLABishop (353-431) Paulinus was from a family of senators, prefects, and consuls. He was educated with great care and his eloquence in prose and verse was admired by St. Jerome and St. Augustine. He had more than doubled his wealth by marriage and was one of the foremost men of his time. Though he was the chosen friend of Saints and had a great devotion to St. Felix of Nola, he was still a catechumen trying to serve two masters. But God drew Paulinus to Himself along the way of the Cross. Paulinus received baptism, withdrew into Spain to be alone, and then, in consort with his holy wife, sold all their vast estates in various parts of the empire, distributing their proceeds so prudently that St. Jerome says East and West were filled with his alms. He was then ordained and retired to Nola in Campania. There, he rebuilt the Church of St. Felix and served its people night and day, living a life of extreme abstinence and toil. In 409, Paulinus was chosen bishop, and for more than thirty years tended his flock. His sanctity was conspicuous in an age blessed with many great and wise bishops. St. Gregory the Great tells us that when the Vandals of Africa had made a descent on Campania, Bp. Paulinus spent all he had in relieving the distress of his people and ransoming them from slavery. When a poor widow's son was taken captive by the son-in-law of the vandal king, she came to Paulinus for help. Having exhausted all his revenue, Bp. Paulinus laid down his life and exchanged places with the widow's son, to spend the rest of his life in captivity and enslavement. The widow attempted to change his mind, but Bp. Paulinus could not be disuaded. Bp. Paulinus went to Africa and was accepted in place of the widow's son. After Paulinus toiled as a gardener for some time, the vandal king found out that his son-in-law's slave was the Bishop of Nola. He at once freed Bp. Paulinus and all the townsmen of Nola. One who knew Bp. Paulinus well said he was meek like Moses, priestlike as Aaron, innocent as Samuel, tender as David, wise as Solomon, apostolic as Peter, loving as John, cautious as Thomas, keen-sighted as Stephen and fervent as Apollos. He passed away in 431, but the miracles from his intercession show that he lives forever.</p>"

None were left among the people of the land except the poor.<br />He deported Jehoiachin to Babylon, and also led captive from Jerusalem to Babylon the king's mother and wives, his functionaries, and the chief men of the land.<br />The king of Babylon also led captive to Babylon all seven thousand men of the army, and a thousand craftsmen and smiths, all of them trained soldiers.<br />In place of Jehoiachin, the king of Babylon appointed his uncle Mattaniah king, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>79(78),1-2.3-5.8.9.</em><p>O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; <br />they have defiled your holy temple, <br />they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.<br />They have given the corpses of your servants <br />as food to the birds of heaven, <br />the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.<br />They have poured out their blood like water <br />round about Jerusalem, <br />and there is no one to bury them.<br />We have become the reproach of our neighbors, <br />the scorn and derision of those around us.<br />O LORD, how long? Will you be angry forever? <br />Will your jealousy burn like fire?<br />Remember not against us the iniquities of the past; <br />may your compassion quickly come to us, <br />for we are brought very low.<br />Help us, O God our savior, <br />because of the glory of your name; <br />deliver us and pardon our sins <br />for your name's sake.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>7,21-29.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven.<br />Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive out demons in your name? Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?'<br />Then I will declare to them solemnly, 'I never knew you. Depart from me, you evildoers.'<br />Everyone who listens to these words of mine and acts on them will be like a wise man who built his house on rock.<br />The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house. But it did not collapse; it had been set solidly on rock.<br />And everyone who listens to these words of mine but does not act on them will be like a fool who built his house on sand.<br />The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and buffeted the house. And it collapsed and was completely ruined.\"<br />When Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,<br />for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.</p><hr /><h3>St. Etheldreda(abbess (7th century))</h3><p>SAINT ETHELDREDAAbbess(7th century) St. Etheldreda was raised by a loving family and received the Faith from her parents. Her mother and three sisters are also saints. Etheldreda wanted to enter the religious state, but was compelled to marry Tonbercht, a tributary of the Mercian king. She lived with him as a virgin for three years, and after his death retired to the Isle of Ely. Etheldreda's peaceful contemplation was interrupted when the king of Northumbria, Egfrid, forced her into a second marriage. Her life at his court was ascetical rather than regal. She lived as his sister and not his wife. Thus Etheldreda observed regular discipline, devotions and works of mercy and love. After twelve years, with her husband's consent, she retired to Coldingham Abbey under the rule of St. Ebba, and received the veil from St. Wilfrid. After Etheldreda's departure, King Egfrid reneged on his promise and tried to take her back. She took refuge on a headland on the coast near Coldingham; and here a miracle took place. The waters forced themselves around the hill, barring Egfrid's advance. After seven days, the king recognized divine will and left Etheldreda in peace. God will not fail us if, with a single heart, we elect for him. In 672, Etheldreda returned to Ely and founded a double monastery. As the abbess, she was a living example of the Good Shepherd and a temple of the Holy Spirit. Some time after her death in 679, Etheldreda's body was found incorrupt, and St. Bede recorded many miracles at her tomb.</p><hr /><h3>St. Liebert()</h3><hr />"

Her parents are Fortino GarcÃ­a and Refugio Zavala de GarcÃ­a.As a child, MarÃ­a was known for her piety and made frequent visits to the Basilica of Our Lady of Zapopan, which was located next to the religious goods shop run by her father. Her love for God was particularly demonstrated in her love for the poor. With uncommon transparency and simplicity, MarÃ­a treated everyone with equal love and respect. Although as a young woman she planned to marry Gustavo Arreola, she suddenly broke off her engagement when she was twenty-three years old. The reason: MarÃ­a \"understood\" that Jesus was calling her to love him with an undivided heart as part of the religious life.She fully believed that she was called to do this by giving assistance to the poor and sick. When MarÃ­a confided to her spiritual director, Fr. Cipriano IÃ±iguez, her \"sudden change of heart,\" he told her that for some time he had the inspiration to found a religious congregation that would provide assistance to the hospitalized. He invited MarÃ­a to join him in this foundation. The new Congregation, which officially began on October 13, 1901, was known as the \"Handmaids of St. Margaret Mary (Alacoque) and the Poor.\"\"Poor with the poor\" MarÃ­a worked as a nurse, giving assistance to the first patients that were welcomed into \"their hospital.\" Regardless of the poverty and lack of material goods of the patients, compassion and care for the physical and spiritual well-being of the sick were the primary concerns, and MarÃ­a gave of herself wholeheartedly to carry out this task of love. Sr MarÃ­a was named Superior General of the quickly-growing Congregation. Her example taught the Sisters the importance of living a genuine and joyful exterior and interior poverty. She was convinced that it was only through loving and living poverty that one could be truly \"poor with the poor.\" Indeed, Mother MarÃ­a was known for her simplicity, humility and willingness to accept all that came from the hand of God.Risking life to help those hiding From 1911 until 1936, the political-religious situation in Mexico became uneasy and the Catholic Church underwent persecution. Mother MarÃ­a put her own life at risk to help the priests and the Archbishop of Guadalajara to \"go into hiding\" in the hospital. She did not limit her charity simply to helping the \"righteous,\" but also gave food and care to the persecutors who lived near the hospital. It was not long before they, too, began defending the sick in the hospital run by the Sisters. The last two years of Mother MarÃ­a's life were lived in extreme suffering because of a grave illness, and on 24 June 1963, she passed away at the age of eighty-five.During the lifetime of the foundress, eleven foundations were established in the Republic of Mexico.Today, the Congregation has twenty-two foundations and is present in five different countries: Mexico, Peru, Iceland, Greece and Italy. After Mother MarÃ­a's passing, patients at her hospitals received healing that was inexplicable to medical science. They were cured after asking Mother MarÃ­a' for help before God. St. MarÃ­a was canonized on May 12, 2013 by Pope Francis. Her intercession can be fully relied upon for cases relating to her works and ministry.</p>"

Earnest to lead a penitential life, William left Piedmont when he was fifteen and made an austere pilgrimage to St. James' in Galicia. Afterward, he retired to the kingdom of Naples, where he chose for his abode a desert mountain. There, he lived in perpetual contemplation and practiced penance and mortification. Finding himself discovered and his contemplation interrupted, William relocated to Monte-Vergine, situated between Nola and Benevento in the same kingdom. However, his reputation followed him, and he was obliged by two neighboring priests to permit certain fervent persons to live with him and to imitate his ascetic practices. Thus began, in 1119, the foundation of the religious congregation called de Monte-Vergine. William passed away on June 25, 1142.

Our Saint appears to have been a layman of great virtue and of extraordinary talents and learning. He wrote several works in which he ably refuted the errors of heresy. St. Leo the Great, being chosen Pope in 440, invited St. Prosper to Rome, made him his secretary, and employed him in the most important affairs of the Church.

(...) He was a real master of Christian living and reached the heights of contemplation with continuous prayer, constant mortification, a daily effort to work carried out with exemplary docility to the motions of the Holy Spirit, with the aim of serving the Church as the Church wishes to be served.\" From the Apostolic Brief regarding the Beatification of the Venerable Servant of God JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡, Priest, Founder of Opus Dei:********************A bright and cheerful home JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡ was born in Barbastro, Spain, on 9 January 1902, the second of six children born to JosÃ© EscrivÃ¡ and MarÃ­a Dolores AlbÃ¡s. His parents were devout Catholics and had him baptised on 13 January that year. Through their example, JosemarÃ­a received a firm grounding in faith and Christian virtues: love for frequent Confession and Holy Communion, a trusting recourse to prayer, devotion to Our Lady, and helping those in greatest need. JosemarÃ­a grew up as a cheerful, lively and straightforward child, fun-loving, good at study, intelligent and with an observing eye. He had a great affection for his mother and a trusting friendship with his father, who encouraged him to feel free to open his heart and tell him his worries, and was always ready to answer his questions with affection and prudence. It was not long before Our Lord began to temper his soul in the forge of sorrow. Between 1910 and 1913, his three younger sisters died; and in 1914, his family suffered financial ruin. In 1915, the EscrivÃ¡s moved to LogroÃ±o, a nearby town, where their father found work to support the family. In the winter of 1917-18, something happened which decisively influenced JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡'s future. The snow fell very heavily that Christmas in LogroÃ±o, and one day he saw some frozen footprints in the snow. They had been left by a discalced Carmelite. JosemarÃ­a found himself wondering: \"If others sacrifice so much for God and their neighbour, couldn't I do something too?\" This was how God started to speak to his heart: \"I began to have an inkling of what Love is, to realise that my heart was yearning for something great, for love.\" He did not yet know what precisely God wanted of him, but he decided to become a priest, thinking that it would make him more available to fulfil God's will.Priestly ordination Having completed his secondary education, JosemarÃ­a started his priestly studies at the Seminary of LogroÃ±o, passing on, in 1920, to the Seminary of Saragossa, at whose Pontifical University he completed his formation prior to ordination. At his father's suggestion and with the permission of his ecclesiastical superiors, he also studied Law at the University of Saragossa. His generous and cheerful character and his straightforwardness and calm approach to things won him many friends. His life of piety, respect for discipline and endeavour in study were an example to his fellow seminarians. In 1922, when he was but twenty years of age, he was appointed an inspector or prefect in the Seminary by the Archbishop of Saragossa. During that time, he spent many hours praying before the Blessed Sacrament. His spiritual life became deeply rooted in the Eucharist. Each day, he also visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar, asking Mary to request God to show him what He wanted him to do. As he recalled on 2 October 1968, \"Since I felt those inklings of God's love, I sought to carry out, within the limits of my smallness, what he expected from this poor instrument. (...) And, with those yearnings, I prayed and prayed and prayed, in constant prayer. I kept on repeating: 'Domine, ut sit! Domine, ut videam!' like the poor fellow in the Gospel, who shouted out because God can do everything. Lord, that I may see! Lord, that it may come to be! And I also repeated (...) filled with confidence in my heavenly Mother: 'Domina, ut sit!, Domina, ut videam!' The Blessed Virgin has always helped me to discover her Son's desires.\" On 27 November 1924, his father, JosÃ© EscrivÃ¡, died suddenly and unexpectedly. On 28 March 1925, JosemarÃ­a was ordained a priest by Bishop DÃ­az GÃ³mara in the church of the Seminary of St. Charles in Saragossa. Two days later, he celebrated his first Solemn Mass in the Holy Chapel of the Basilica of Our Lady of Pilar. On March 31, he moved to Perdiguera, a small country village, where he had been appointed assistant regent to the parish. In April 1927, with the consent of his Archbishop, he took up residence in Madrid to study for his doctorate in Civil Law, a degree which at that time was only granted by the Central University in the Spanish capital. In Madrid, his apostolic zeal soon brought him into contact with a wide variety of people: students, artists, workers, academics, priests. He spent many hours caring for children, and for sick and poverty-stricken people in the outer suburbs of the city. At the same time, he taught law to earn a living for himself and his mother and sister and young brother. For a good many years, the family were in serious financial difficulties, which they bore with dignity and courage. Our Lord blessed Fr. JosemarÃ­a with abundant graces, both ordinary and extraordinary. They found a fertile reception in his generous soul and produced much fruit in the service of the Church and souls.The foundation of Opus Dei Opus Dei was born on 2 October 1928. JosemarÃ­a was spending some days on retreat and, while doing his meditation on some notes regarding the inner motions he had received from God in the previous years, he suddenly saw - to see was the term he always used to describe the foundational experience - the mission the Lord wanted to entrust to him: to open up in the Church a new vocational path, aimed at spreading the quest for holiness and the practice of apostolate through the sanctification of ordinary work in the middle of the world, without changing one's place. A few months later, on 14 February 1930, God made him understand that Opus Dei was to spread among women also. From that moment onward, JosemarÃ­a devoted all his energies to the fulfilment of his foundational mission, fostering among men and women from all areas of society a personal commitment to follow Christ, to love their neighbour and seek holiness in daily life. He did not see himself as an innovator or reformer, for he was convinced that Jesus Christ is eternally new and that the Holy Spirit is constantly rejuvenating the Church, for whose service God has brought Opus Dei into existence. Fully aware that the task entrusted to him was supernatural by nature, he proceeded to dig deep foundations for his work, based on prayer and penance, on a joyous awareness of his being a son of God and on tireless work. People of all sorts began to follow him and, in particular, university students and teachers, among whom he awakened a genuine determination to serve everyone, firing in them a desire to place Christ at the heart of all human activities by means of work that is sanctified, and sanctifies both the doer and those for whom it is done. This was the goal he set for the initiatives of the faithful of Opus Dei: to lift up to God, with the help of grace, each and every created reality, so that Christ may reign in everyone and in everything; to get to know Christ Jesus; to get Him known by others; to take Him everywhere. JosemarÃ­a declared that the divine paths of the earth have been opened up.Apostolic expansion In 1933, he started a university Centre, the DYA Academy, because he grasped that the world of human knowledge and culture is a key to the evangelisation of society as a whole. In 1934, he published Spiritual Considerations, the first version of The Way. Since then, there have been 372 printings of the book in 44 languages and its circulation has passed the four and a half million mark. While Opus Dei was thus taking its first steps, the Spanish Civil War broke out. It was 1936. There were serious outbreaks of religious violence in Madrid. To these, Fr. JosemarÃ­a responded heroically with prayer, penance and apostolic endeavour. It was a time of suffering for the whole Church, but also a time of spiritual and apostolic growth, and for strengthening hope. By 1939, with the war over, the Founder of Opus Dei was able to give new vigour to his apostolic work all over the Spanish peninsula. In particular, he mobilised many young university students to take Christ to every area of society and discover the greatness of the Christian calling. At the same time, with his reputation for holiness growing, many Bishops invited him to preach to their clergy and to lay people involved in Catholic organisations. Similar petitions came to him from the superiors of religious orders; he always said yes. In 1941, while he was preaching a retreat to priests in Lerida, in the North of Spain, his mother, who had been a great help to him in the apostolates of Opus Dei, died. God also let him become the butt of harsh misunderstandings. The Bishop of Madrid, Bishop Eijo y Garay gave him his fullest backing and granted the first canonical approval to Opus Dei. Fr. JosemarÃ­a accepted difficulties with a prayerful and cheerful attitude, aware that all those desiring to live piously in Christ Jesus will meet persecution (2 Tim 3:12) and he recommended his spiritual children, in the face of these attacks, to forgive ungrudgingly: don't answer back, but pray, work and smile. In 1943, through a new foundational grace he received while celebrating Holy Mass, there came to birth - within Opus Dei - the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, in which priests proceeding from the faithful of Opus Dei could be incardinated. The fact of all the faithful of Opus Dei, both laity and priests, belonging fully to Opus Dei, with both laity and priests cooperating organically in its apostolates, is a feature of the foundational charism, which the Church confirmed in 1982 when giving Opus Dei its definitive status in Church Law as a Personal Prelature. On 25 June 1944, three engineers were ordained to the priesthood. One of them was Alvaro del Portillo, who would eventually succeed the Founder as the head of Opus Dei. In the years that followed, close to a thousand laymen of Opus Dei reached the priesthood at the encouragement of Blessed JosemarÃ­a. The Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, which is intrinsically united to the Prelature of Opus Dei, also carries out, in close harmony with the Pastors of the local Churches, activities of spiritual formation for diocesan priests and candidates to the priesthood. Diocesan priests, too may belong to the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, while maintaining unchanged their status as clergy of their respective dioceses.A Roman and universal spirit As soon as the end of the world war was in sight, Fr. JosemarÃ­a began to prepare apostolic work in other countries. As he pointed out, \"Jesus wants his Work from the outset to have a universal, Catholic heart.\" In 1946, he moved to Rome in order to obtain papal recognition for Opus Dei. On 24 February 1947, Pius XII granted Opus Dei the decretum laudis, or decree of praise; and three years later, on 16 June 1950, the Church's definitive approval. Since then, it has been possible to admit as Cooperators of Opus Dei men and women who are not Catholic and not even Christian, but who wish to help its apostolic works, with their work, alms and prayer. The headquarters of Opus Dei were fixed in Rome to emphasise even more clearly the aspiration which is the guiding force of all its work: to serve the Church as the Church wishes to be served, in close union with the see of Peter and the hierarchy of the Church. On several occasions, Pius XII and John XXIII sent Fr. JosemarÃ­a expressions of their affection and esteem; Paul VI wrote to him in 1964 describing Opus Dei as \"a living expression of the perennial youthfulness of the Church\". This stage too of the life of the Founder of Opus Dei was characterised by all kinds of trials. Not only was his health affected by many sufferings (for more than ten years he had a serious form of diabetes, from which he was miraculously cured in 1954), but also there were financial hardships and the difficulties arising from the expansion of the apostolic works worldwide. Nevertheless, he kept smiling throughout, because true virtue is not sad or disagreeable, but pleasantly cheerful. His permanent good humour was a constant witness to his unconditional love for God's will. The world is little when Love is great: his desire to flood the earth with the light of Christ led him to follow up the calls that many Bishops made to him from all over the world, asking Opus Dei to help them in the work of evangelisation with its apostolates. Many varied projects were undertaken: colleges to impart professional training, schools for agricultural workers, universities, primary and secondary schools, hospitals and medical centres, etc. These activities, which he often compared to a shoreless sea, originate at the initiative of ordinary Christians who seek to meet specific local needs with a lay mentality and a professional approach. They are open to people of all races, religions and social backgrounds, because their unmistakably Christian outlook is always matched by a deep respect for the freedom of consciences. When John XXIII announced his decision to call an Ecumenical Council, Fr. JosemarÃ­a began to pray and get others to pray for the happy outcome of this great initiative of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, as he wrote in a letter in 1962. As a result of the deliberations of the Council, the Church's solemn Magisterium was to confirm fundamental aspects of the spirit of Opus Dei, such as the universal call to holiness; professional work as a means to holiness and apostolate; the value and lawful limits of Christian freedom in temporal affairs; and the Holy Mass as the centre and root of the interior life. Blessed JosemarÃ­a met numerous Council Fathers and experts, who saw him as a forerunner of many of the master lines of the Second Vatican Council. Profoundly identified with the Council's teaching, he diligently fostered its implementation through the formative activities of Opus Dei all over the world.Holiness in the midst of the world \"Heaven and earth seem to merge ... on the horizon. But where they really meet is in your hearts, when you sanctify your everyday lives.\" Fr. JosemarÃ­a preached constantly that interior life is more important than organising activities. In The Way, he wrote, \"These world crises are crises of saints. God wants a handful of men 'of his own' in every human activity. And then... 'pax Christi in regno Christi - the peace of Christ in the kingdom of Christ.'\" He insisted that holiness always requires prayer, work and apostolate to be intertwined in what he called a \"unity of life,\" \"unitas,\" and practised this himself with cheerful perseverance. He was utterly convinced that in order to attain sanctity through daily work, one needs to struggle to be a soul of prayer, of deep inner life. When a person lives this way, everything becomes prayer, everything can and ought to lead us to God, feeding our constant contact with Him, from morning till night. Every kind of work can become prayer, and every kind of work become prayer turns into apostolate. The root of the astonishing fruitfulness of his ministry lies in his ardent interior life, which made him a contemplative in the midst of the world. His interior life fed on prayer and the sacraments, and expressed itself in a passionate love for the Eucharist, in the depth with which he lived the Mass as the centre and root of his own life, in his tender devotion to the Virgin Mary, to St. Joseph and the Guardian Angels, and in his faithfulness to the Church and the Pope.The definitive encounter with the Most Holy Trinity During the last years of his life, the Founder of Opus Dei undertook a number of catechetical journeys to countries in Europe and Latin America. Wherever he went, there were meetings that were always simple and familiar in tone, even though the listeners often numbered in thousands. He would speak about God, the sacraments, Christian devotions, the sanctification of work, and his love for the Church and the Pope. On 28 March 1975, he celebrated his priestly Golden Jubilee. His prayer that day was like a summing up of his whole life: \"Fifty years have gone by, and I am still like a faltering child. I am just beginning, beginning again, as I do each day in my interior life. And it will be so to the end of my days: always beginning anew.\" On 26 June 1975, at midday, Blessed JosemarÃ­a died in his workroom of a cardiac arrest, giving a glast glance before a picture of Our Lady which received his last glance. At the time, Opus Dei was present in all five continents, with over 60,000 members from 80 nationalities. His books of spirituality (The Way, Holy Rosary, Conversations with Mgr EscrivÃ¡, Christ is Passing By, Friends of God, Love for the Church, The Way of the Cross, Furrow, The Forge) have reached millions of copies. After his death, many people asked the Holy Father for his canonisation. On 17 May 1992, in Rome, Pope John Paul II raised JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡ to the altars, in a beatification ceremony before hundreds of thousands of pilgrims. On 21 September 2001, the Ordinary Congregation of Cardinal and Bishop members of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints unanimously confirmed the miraculous character of a cure attributed to Blessed JosemarÃ­a. The decree regarding this miracle was read before the Holy Father on 20 December. On 26 February 2002, Pope John Paul II presided over an Ordinary Public Consistory of Cardinals and, having heard the Cardinals, Archbishops and Bishops present, he established that the ceremony for the Canonisation of Blessed JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡ should take place on 6 October 2002.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Jacques Ghazir Haddad((1875-1954))</h3><hr /><p>Bl. Jacques Ghazir HaddadPriest Founder of the Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Cross(1875-1954) Fr. Jacques Ghazir Haddad was born on 1 February 1875, in Ghazir, Lebanon, the third of five children. He attended school in Ghazir and then the College de la Sageese in Beirut where he studied Arabic, French and Syriac.In 1892, he went to Alexandria, Egypt, to teach Arabic at the Christian Brothers' College, and there he felt the call to the priesthood. He entered the Capuchin Convent in Khashbau the next year. He was ordained a priest on 1 November 1901 in Beirut, Lebanon. As an itinerant preacher from 1903 to 1914, he walked all over Lebanon proclaiming the Word of God and was given the name \"the Apostle of Lebanon.\" He was also seen preaching in Syria, Palestine, Iraq and Turkey.In 1919, he bought a piece of land on the hill of Jall-Eddib, north of Beirut, where he built a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of the Sea. Nearby, he erected a great Cross. Fr. Jacques was tireless, he would help anyone in need following in the footsteps of St. Francis of Assisi. In 1920, to assist him in this mission to help the sick and the poor, he founded the Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Cross of Lebanon.The modest work of Fr. Jacques aroused the people's admiration. Many poor and sick people began to go to the \"Cross\" and Fr. Jacques would welcome them all. In 1950, the \"Cross\" became exclusively a psychiatric hospital, one of the most modern in the Near East. The movement of charity began to spread throughout Lebanon and Fr. Jacques and his Sisters multiplied their works of social assistance.In 1933, he opened the House of the Sacred Heart in Deir el-Kamar, a girls' orphanage, which later became a refuge for the chronically ill. In 1948, he opened the Hospital of Our Lady for the aged, the chronically ill and the paralyzed. In 1949, St. Joseph's Hospital became one of the most important medical centres of the capital.It was followed in 1950 by St. Anthony's House in Beirut for beggars and vagabonds whom the police found on the streets and Providence House for homeless girls. Fr. Jacques was worn out by vigils, fatigue and travel. Although he suffered from numerous illnesses, became almost completely blind and was stricken with leukemia, he did not stop blessing God and working. He was lucid to the end, his last hours were an uninterrupted series of prayers invoking the Cross and the Virgin Mary until he died on 26 June 1954 in Lebanon. His cause for Beatification was introduced in February 1979. On 24 February 1979, Pope John Paul II signed the Decree of Introduction of the Cause for Beatification.On Sunday, 22 June 2008, he was beatified during a special Mass in Beirut by Cardinal JosÃ© Saraiva Martins, C.M.F., Prefect of Congregation for the Causes of Saints.</p><hr /><h3>Sts. John and Paul(Martyrs (+ c. 362))</h3><hr /><p>SAINTS JOHN AND PAULMartyrs(+ c. 362) Sts. John and Paul were officers in the army under Julian the Apostate. They received the crown of martyrdom probably in 362. They glorified God by rejecting seductive offers and by overcoming threats and torture through the Holy Cross. Officers John and Paul saw many wicked men prosper, but were not dazzled by the example. They considered that worldly prosperity which attends impunity in sin is the most dreadful of all judgments. The false prosperity of Julian was short-lived as he died a glory hound, victim to his own vanity. By the momentary labor of their suffering, Sts. John and Paul received a treasure of infinite value: eternal life and the beatific vision. The worth of their efforts in enduring torture was confirmed by Jesus Christ, who reassured and consoled them along the way of the Cross. As each was awarded the crown of martyrdom by the Great King and Good Shepherd, they received the beatific vision, seeing God face to face, and interceding for the Church for all eternity.</p>"

Tempered in the forge of Christian charity and nurtured with prayer and the sacraments, Cyril's intellect and will oriented toward truth and goodness. In adulthood, Cyril was consecrated bishop after his uncle, Theophilus, passed away. Bp. Cyril rose to challenge the contradictions and unfounded teachings of the heretic Nestorius. Against history and written accounts, Nestorius claimed Jesus is not the messiah. His teaching was cherry-picked while contradicting other parts that belong to the whole. Like all heresy, Nestorianism set the mood against the mind. After unsuccessfully trying to convert Nestorius, Bp. Cyril attended the Council of Ephesus, where the Christian world answered heresies besetting the Church. Representing Christianity, the Council found that Nestorianism was unsubstantiated. Nestorius was excommunicated and removed from ecclesiastical office. The nature of Christ and the divine maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Church, were upheld. Bp. Cyril contended with the forces assailing the Church. \"He was a man of sorrows (Is. 53:3).\" Going to his final rest in the year 444, St. Cyril may have heard the Master's voice: \"Well done, good and faithful servant! ... Enter into the joy of your master (Mt. 25:23)!\" For his contribution to unpacking the richness of the Catholic faith, St. Cyril was given the honorific title Doctor of the Church in 1882.</p><hr /><h3>St. Lasdilas(King (1041-1095))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT LADISLASKing(1041-1095) St. Ladislas was the first son of Bela, King of Hungary, born in 1041. In a twist of fate, he was compelled, much against his own inclination, to ascend the throne in 1080. He restored the good laws and discipline that St. Stephen had established. St. Ladislas' life in the palace was somewhat austere. Although frugal and self-disciplined, he was liberal with the Church and the poor. Vanity or idle amusements had no share in his time. He sought the Lord in his duties, joining his heart to God through work. Besides the strict and impartial administration of justice, King Ladislas was generous and merciful to his enemies, and vigorous in the defense of his country and the Church. He drove the Huns out of his territories and vanquished invading Turkic armies. As King Ladislas was preparing to reinforce Catholic leaders in present-day Czech Republic, God called him from the earth on July 30, 1095. He is remembered as a humble and morally upright king. Through prayer, adoration and the Sacraments, we too may receive God with the spirit and fervor of the Saints.</p>"

We are perishing!\"<br />He said to them, \"Why are you terrified, O you of little faith?\" Then he got up, rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was great calm.<br />The men were amazed and said, \"What sort of man is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey?\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Irenaeus(Bishop and Martyr (+ 202) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINT IRENÃUSBishop and Martyr (+ 202) St. IrenÃ¦us was born about the year 120. He was a Grecian, probably a native of Asia Minor. For education, his Christian parents placed him under the care of the great St. Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna. In this school, he learned theology and became a champion of faith against heresies. St. Polycarp cultivated IrenÃ¦us' intellect and formed his mind through teaching and example. IrenÃ¦us highly esteemed his tutor and emulated every action. He listened to Polycarp's instructions with curiosity and intent, engraving the latter's character upon his heart, so the impressions remained lively even to old age. In order to confute heresies, IrenÃ¦us made himself acquainted with the conceits of philosophers, tracing their mood as the source of error and setting it in full light. In due time, Bp. Polycarp sent IrenÃ¦us to Gaul accompanied by a priest. Soon after, IrenÃ¦us was ordained to the priesthood by St. Pothinus in the Church of Lyons. After St. Pothinus passed away in 177, IrenÃ¦us was consecrated the second Bishop of Lyons. Through works and preaching, Bp. IrenÃ¦us converted almost the whole country in a short time. Bp. IrenÃ¦us wrote several works against heresy. He andmany others suffered martyrdom in Lyons about the year 202 under the Emperor Severus.</p>"

(It was (the) feast of Unleavened Bread.)<br />He had him taken into custody and put in prison under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. He intended to bring him before the people after Passover.<br />Peter thus was being kept in prison, but prayer by the church was fervently being made to God on his behalf.<br />On the very night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter, secured by double chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while outside the door guards kept watch on the prison.<br />Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, \"Get up quickly.\" The chains fell from his wrists.<br />The angel said to him, \"Put on your belt and your sandals.\" He did so. Then he said to him, \"Put on your cloak and follow me.\"<br />So he followed him out, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.<br />They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate leading out to the city, which opened for them by itself. They emerged and made their way down an alley, and suddenly the angel left him.<br />Then Peter recovered his senses and said, \"Now I know for certain that (the) Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>34(33),2-3.4-5.6-7.8-9.</em><p>I will bless the LORD at all times; <br />his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br />Let my soul glory in the LORD; <br />the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br />Glorify the LORD with me, <br />let us together extol his name.<br />I sought the LORD, and he answered me <br />and delivered me from all my fears.<br />Look to him that you may be radiant with joy, <br />and your faces may not blush with shame.<br />When the poor one called out, the LORD heard, <br />and from all his distress he saved him.<br />The angel of the LORD encamps <br />around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br />Taste and see how good the LORD is; <br />blessed the man who takes refuge in him.</p><h3>Second Letter to Timothy</h3><em>4,6-8.17-18.</em><p>Beloved: I am already being poured out like a libation, and the time of my departure is at hand.<br />I have competed well; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith.<br />From now on the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but to all who have longed for his appearance.<br />But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the proclamation might be completed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was rescued from the lion's mouth.<br />The Lord will rescue me from every evil threat and will bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>16,13-19.</em><p>Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi and he asked his disciples, âWho do people say that the Son of Man is?â<br />They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\"<br />He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\"<br />Simon Peter said in reply, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\"<br />Jesus said to him in reply, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.<br />And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.<br />I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Judith()</h3>"

There earn your bread by prophesying,<br />but never again prophesy in Bethel; for it is the king's sanctuary and a royal temple.\"<br />Amos answered Amaziah, \"I was no prophet, nor have I belonged to a company of prophets; I was a shepherd and a dresser of sycamores.<br />The LORD took me from following the flock, and said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.\"<br />Now hear the word of the LORD!\" You say: prophesy not against Israel, preach not against the house of Isaac.<br />Now thus says the LORD: Your wife shall be made a harlot in the city, and your sons and daughters shall fall by the sword; Your land shall be divided by measuring line, and you yourself shall die in an unclean land; Israel shall be exiled far from its land.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>19(18),8.9.10.11.</em><p>The law of the LORD is perfect, <br />refreshing the soul; <br />The decree of the LORD is trustworthy, <br />giving wisdom to the simple.<br />The precepts of the LORD are right,<br />rejoicing the heart; <br />The command of the LORD is clear, <br />enlightening the eye.  <br />The fear of the LORD is pure, <br />enduring forever; <br />The ordinances of the LORD are true, <br />all of them just.<br />They are more precious than gold, <br />Than a heap of purest gold; <br />Sweeter also than syrup <br />Or honey from the comb.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>9,1-8.</em><p>After entering a boat, Jesus made the crossing, and came into his own town.<br />And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Courage, child, your sins are forgiven.\"<br />At that, some of the scribes said to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming.\"<br />Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said, \"Why do you harbor evil thoughts?<br />Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?<br />But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" --he then said to the paralytic, \"Rise, pick up your stretcher, and go home.\"<br />He rose and went home.<br />When the crowds saw this they were struck with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to human beings.</p><hr /><h3>1st Martyrs of Rome (+ 1st century)()</h3><p>The FIRST MARTYRS of the CHURCH of ROME(+ 1st century) The first Roman persecution of Christians was in 64 AD. Orchestrated by Emperor Nero, Christians were scapegoats for a fire that nearly destroyed Rome in July that year. Some Christians were burned as living torches at evening banquets, others were crucified and others were fed to wild animals. Their deaths are recorded by the pagan writer Tacitus in his Annales (15, 44) and also by Pope Clement I in his letter to the Corinthians, chapters 5-6.*******PrayerFather,you sanctified the Church of Romewith the blood of its first martyrs.May we find strength from their courageand rejoice in their triumph.</p>"
