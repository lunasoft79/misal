He was fervent in every exercise of piety, which testified to the love of his parents.Having embraced the monastic state at Tintillant near Angers, he was a model of virtue, relying upon the will of God rather than his own. At the age of thirty-five, he was appointed abbot; and twenty-five years afterwards, Bishop of Angers. He restored discipline in the Church. \"His disciples remembered ... 'Zeal for your house will consume me'\" (Jn. 2:17, Ps. 69:9). Bp. Albinus' mortifications of the flesh and constant recollection of soul disposed his spirit to the will of the Divine.Powerful in works and miracles, Bp. Albinus looked upon himself as an \"unprofitable servant\" (Lk. 17:10). In the third Council of Orleans, in 538, he procured the revival of the thirtieth canon of the Council of Epaone; excommunicating those who contract incestuous marriages in the first or second degree of consanguinity.</p><hr /><h3>St. David(Bishop (+ 561))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT DAVIDBishop(+ 561) St. David, son of Sant, Prince of Cardigan and of Non, was born in Wales in the fifth century. From his earliest years and beginning the age of reason, he gave himself wholly to the service of God.St. David began his religious life under St. Paulinus, a disciple of St. Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, who Pope St. Celestine sent to Britain to stop Pelagius' heresy. When the heresy reappeared in the beginning of the sixth century, the bishops assembled at Brevi. Unable to address the people who came to hear the word of truth, they sent for St. David from his cell to preach to them. The Saint came, and it is related that, as he preached, the ground beneath his feet rose and became a hill, so that he was heard by an innumerable crowd. The heresy fell under the sword of the Spirit, and the Saint was elected Bishop of Caerleon on the resignation of St. Dubricius. St. David founded twelve monasteries and governed his Church according to the canons sanctioned in Rome.At last, when about eighty years of age, he laid himself down, knowing that his hour had come. As his agony closed, our Lord stood before him in a vision, and the Saint cried out: \"Take me up with Thee,\" and so gave up his soul on Tuesday, March 1, 561.</p>"

Leo and Hilarius, succeeding them in the pontificate in 468. His pontificate was beset by persecution. All the provinces of the Western Empire, out of Italy, had fallen into the hands of Gothic nations. In the eighth year of his pontificate, Rome fell prey to foreigners. Italy was left almost a desert without inhabitants; and the imperial armies consisted chiefly of Gothic mercenaries, hired under the name of auxiliaries. The mercenaries saw that their masters were in their power. The Heruli demanded one third of the lands of Italy. For their leader, they chose Odoacer, a resolute and intrepid man, who was proclaimed king of Rome in 476. He put to death Orestes, the regent of the empire for his son Augustulus. Odoacer spared Augustulus, and appointed him a salary of six thousand pounds of gold, with permition him to live at full liberty near Naples.Pope Simplicius was wholly taken up in comforting and relieving the afflicted, and in sowing the seeds of the Catholic faith among the Goths. The East gave Pope Simplicius no less employment and concern. Peter Cnapheus, a Eutychian, was made Patriarch of Antioch by heretics; and Peter Mengus made Patriach of Alexandria. Acacius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, received the sentence of St. Simplicius against Cnapheus, but supported Mongus against him and the Catholic Church, and was a notorious double-dealer who made religion serve his agenda. St. Simplicius discovered Acacius' intrigues, and redoubled his zeal to maintain the holy faith, which he saw betrayed on every side. St. Simplicius, having sat fifteen years, eleven months, and six days, went to receive the reward of his labors in 483. He was buried in St. Peter's on the 2nd of March.</p><hr /><h3>St. Chad()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Bl. Charles the Good()</h3><hr />"

Her father was a well known banker and philanthropist. Both parents instilled in their daughters the idea that their wealth was simply loaned to them and was to be shared with others. When the family took a trip to the Western part of the United States, Katharine, as a young woman, saw the plight and destitution of the Native Americans. This experience aroused her desire to do something specific to help alleviate their condition. This was the beginning of her lifelong personal and financial support of numerous missions and missionaries in the United States. The first school she established was St. Catherine Native American School in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1887). Later, when visiting Pope Leo XIII in Rome, and asking him for missionaries to staff some of the Native missions that she as a lay person was financing, she was surprised to hear the Pope suggest that she become a missionary herself. After consultation with her spiritual director, Bishop James O'Connor, she made the decision to give herself totally to God, along with her inheritance, through service to Native Americans and African Americans. Her wealth was now transformed into a poverty of spirit that became a daily constant in a life supported only by the bare necessities. On February 12, 1891, she professed her first vows as a religious, founding the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament whose dedication would be to share the message of the Gospel and the life of the Eucharist among Native Americans and African Americans. Always a woman of intense prayer, Katharine found in the Eucharist the source of her love for the poor and oppressed and of her concern to reach out to combat the effects of racism. Knowing that many African Americans were far from free, still living in substandard conditions as sharecroppers or underpaid menials, denied education and constitutional rights enjoyed by others, she felt a compassionate urgency to help change racial attitudes in the United States. The plantation at that time was an entrenched social institution where coloured people continued to be victims of oppression. This was a deep affront to Katharine's sense of justice. The need for quality education loomed before her, and she discussed this need with some who shared her concern about the inequality of education for African Americans in the cities. Restrictions of the law also prevented them in the rural South from obtaining a basic education. Founding and staffing schools for both Native Americans and African Americans throughout the country became a priority for Katharine and her congregation. During her lifetime, she opened, staffed and directly supported nearly 60 schools and missions, especially in the West and Southwest United States. Her crowning educational focus was the establishment in 1925 of Xavier University of Louisiana, the only predominantly Black Catholic institution of higher learning in the United States. Religious education, social service, visiting in homes, in hospitals and in prisons were also included in the ministries of Katharine and the Sisters. In her quiet way, Katharine combined prayerful and total dependence on Divine Providence with determined activism. Her joyous incisiveness, attuned to the Holy Spirit, penetrated obstacles and facilitated her advances for social justice. Through the prophetic witness of Katharine Drexel's initiative, the Church in the United States was enabled to become aware of the grave domestic need for an apostolate among Native Americans and African Americans. She did not hesitate to speak out against injustice, taking a public stance when racial discrimination was in evidence. For the last 18 years of her life she was rendered almost completely immobile because of a serious illness. During these years, she gave herself to a life of adoration and contemplation as she had desired from early childhood. She died on March 3, 1955. Katharine left a four-fold dynamic legacy to her Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, who continue her apostolate today, and indeed to all peoples:– her love for the Eucharist, her spirit of prayer, and her Eucharistic perspective on the unity of all peoples;– her undaunted spirit of courageous initiative in addressing social iniquities among minorities — one hundred years before such concern aroused public interest in the United States;– her belief in the importance of quality education for all, and her efforts to achieve it;– her total giving of self, of her inheritance and all material goods in selfless service of the victims of injustice. Katharine Drexel was beatified by Pope John Paul II on November 20, 1980.</p><hr /><h3>St. Cunegundes(Empress (+ 1040))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT CUNEGUNDESEmpress(+1040) St. Cunegundes was the daughter of Siegfried, the first Count of Luxemburg, and Hadeswige, his pious wife. They raised her in the faith, and married her to St. Henry, Duke of Bavaria, who, upon the death of the Emperor Otho III, was chosen king of the Romans, and crowned on June 6, 1002. She was crowned at Paderborn on St. Laurence's day. In the year 1014, she went with her husband to Rome, and received the imperial crown with him from the hands of Pope Benedict VIII. She had, by St. Henry's consent before her marriage, made a vow of virginity. Calumniators afterwards made vile accusations against her. The holy empress, to remove the scandal of such a slander, trusting in God to prove her innocence, walked over red-hot ploughshares without being hurt. The emperor condemned his too scrupulous fears and credulity, and from that time they lived in the strictest union of hearts, conspiring to promote in everything God's honor and the advancement of piety. Going once to make a retreat in Hesse, she fell dangerously ill, and made a vow to found a monastery if she recovered. After recovering, she founded a monatery at Kaffungen, near Cassel, in the diocese of Paderborn, and gave it to nuns of the Order of St. Benedict. Before it was finished, St. Henry died in 1024. She recommended his soul to the prayers of others, especially to her dear nuns, and expressed her desire of joining them. She had already exhausted her treasures in founding bishoprics and monasteries, and in relieving the poor, and she had little left to give. But still thirsting to embrace perfect evangelical poverty, and to renounce all to serve God without obstacle, she assembled a great number of prelates to the dedication of her church of Kaffungen on the anniversary day of her husband's death, 1025. After the gospel was sung at Mass she offered on the altar a piece of the true cross, and then, putting off her imperial robes, clothed herself with a poor habit. Her hair was cut off, and the bishop put on her a veil, and a ring as a pledge of her fidelity to her heavenly Spouse. After she was consecrated to God in religion, she seemed entirely to forget that she had been empress, and behaved as the last in the house, being persuaded that she was so before God. She prayed and read much, worked with her hands, and took a singular pleasure in visiting and comforting the sick.Thus she passed the last fifteen years of her life. Her mortifications at length reduced her to a very weak condition, and brought on her last sickness. Perceiving that they were preparing a cloth fringed with gold to cover her body after death, she changed color and ordered it to be taken away. She was not at rest till promised she would be buried as a poor religious in her habit. She died on March 3, 1040. Her body was carried to Bamberg and buried near that of her husband. She was solemnly canonized by Innocent III in 1200.</p>"

There was manliness in his conscientious objection to the caprices of others. Having the virtues and beatitudes, St. Casimir prayed routinely, led a disciplined life, and lived chastely. When nobles in Hungary became dissatisfied with their king, they prevailed upon St. Casimir’s father, the king of Poland, to send his son to take over the country. Prince Casimir obeyed his father as many young men obeyed their government. The army he led was outnumbered; and some of his troops deserted because they were unpaid. Hence Prince Casimir returned home upon his officers' advice. The Prince's father was irked at the retreat, and confined his 15-year-old for three months. The Prince made up his mind to abstain from war, and no amount of persuasion could change his mind. He returned to prayer and study, maintaining his decision to remain celibate even under pressure to marry the emperor’s daughter. Prince Casimir reigned briefly as king of Poland during his father’s absence. At twenty three years old, he passed away from lung sickness while visiting Lithuania. He was the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and was buried in Vilnius. He is the patron saint of Poland and Lithuania.</p>"

They ingenuously confessed the truth, and were brought before the judge, who ordered them tortured and their sides torn with iron hooks. Two days later, when the pagans at Cæsarea celebrated a festival, Adrian was exposed to a lion, and was mangled but not killed. An executioner then dispatched him with a sword.Eubulus met a similar fate two days later. The judge offered Eubulus liberty if he sacrificed to idols; but Eubulus refused. For his faithfulness, Eubulus was led to the amphitheater and killed by lions. At the time of their martyrdom, the persecution in Cæsarea had continued for twelve years under three successive governors, Flavian, Urban, and Firmilian.

Preferring a more austere regimen, she entered the Third Order of St. Francis and lived in a hut near the parish church of Corbie in Picardy.After four years of extraordinary penance, St. Francis spoke to her in a vision to reform of the Order. With the blessing of authority, she established her reform throughout a large part of Europe. In spite of opposition, she founded seventeen convents of the strict observance. By the same wonderful prudence, Sr. Colette healed the great schism which then afflicted the Church. The Fathers at Constance were in doubt how to deal with the three claimants to the tiara - John XXIII, Benedict XIII, and Gregory XII. During this crisis, Sr. Colette, together with St. Vincent Ferrer, wrote to the Fathers to depose Benedict XIII, who alone refused his consent to a new election. The reset led to Martin V being elected, to the greater good of the Church. Sr. Colette equally assisted the Council of Basle by her advice and prayers. When God revealed to her the spirit of revolt that was arising, she warned the bishops and legates to retire from the council. Sr. Colette prayed ceaselessly for the Church. When devils assaulted her to detract her from praying, she continued in spite of desolation. Demons would take the form of stinging insects, or bring into her cell the corpses of public criminals, or assume monstrous forms to strike her. Other times, they appeared as seductions and false goods, tempting her to sin with deceit. St. Colette once complained to Our Lord that the demons prevented her from praying. Centuries later, St. Padre Pio would say that his guardian Angel found prayer more pleasing to God when it was done in times of trial or spiritual dryness. Sr. Colette passed away on March 6, 1447 to join our Lord in heaven. She intercedes for souls and the Church forever.</p>"

He ran away from his home in Portugal, tended sheep and cattle in Spain, and served as a soldier against the French, and afterwards against the Turks. When about forty years of age, feeling remorse for his wild life, he resolved to devote himself to the ransom of the Christian slaves in Africa. He went there with the family of an exiled noble, which he maintained by his labor. On his return to Spain, he sought to do good by selling holy pictures and books at low prices. At length, the hour of grace struck. At Granada, a sermon by the celebrated John of Avila shook his soul to its depths; and his expressions of self-abhorrence were so extraordinary that he was taken to the asylum. There, he employed himself in ministering to the sick. On leaving, he began to collect homeless poor, and to support them by his work and by begging. One night, St. John found in the streets a poor man who seemed near death, and, as was his wont, he carried him to the hospital, laid him on a bed, and went to fetch water to wash his feet. When he had washed them, he knelt to kiss them, and started with awe: the feet were pierced, and the print of the nails bright with an unearthly radiance. He raised his eyes to look, and heard the words, \"John, to Me thou doest all that thou doest to the poor in My name: I reach forth My hand for the alms thou givest; Me dost thou clothe, Mine are the feet thou dost wash.\" And then the gracious vision disappeared, leaving St. John filled at once with confusion and consolation. The bishop became the Saint's patron, and gave him the name John of God. When his hospital was on fire, John was seen rushing about uninjured amidst the flames until he had rescued all his poor. After ten years spent in the service of the suffering, the Saint's life closed. He plunged into the river Xenil to save a drowning boy, and died, 1550, of an illness brought on by the attempt, at the age of fifty-five.</p>"

Now Nineveh was an enormously large city; it took three days to go through it.<br />Jonah began his journey through the city, and had gone but a single day's walk announcing, \"Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed,\"<br />when the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth.<br />When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.<br />Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh, by decree of the king and his nobles: \"Neither man nor beast, neither cattle nor sheep, shall taste anything; they shall not eat, nor shall they drink water.<br />Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth and call loudly to God; every man shall turn from his evil way and from the violence he has in hand.<br />Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and withhold his blazing wrath, so that we shall not perish.\"<br />When God saw by their actions how they turned from their evil way, he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to them; he did not carry it out.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>51(50),3-4.12-13.18-19.</em><p>Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; <br />in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.<br />Thoroughly wash me from my guilt <br />and of my sin cleanse me.<br />A clean heart create for me, O God, <br />and a steadfast spirit renew within me.<br />Cast me not out from your presence, <br />and your Holy Spirit take not from me.<br />For you are not pleased with sacrifices; <br />should I offer a burnt offering, you would not accept it.<br />My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit; <br />a heart contrite and humbled, O God, you will not spurn.  </p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>11,29-32.</em><p>While still more people gathered in the crowd, Jesus said to them, \"This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it, except the sign of Jonah.<br />Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.<br />At the judgment the queen of the south will rise with the men of this generation and she will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and there is something greater than Solomon here.<br />At the judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it, because at the preaching of Jonah they repented, and there is something greater than Jonah here.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Frances of Rome(religious (1384-1440))</h3><p>SAINT FRANCES OF ROME Religious (1384-1440) St. Frances was born at Rome in 1384. Her parents were high-ranking officials. They overruled her desire to become a nun, and at twelve married her to Rorenzo Ponziano, a Roman noble. During the forty years of their married life, they never had a disagreement. While spending her days in retirement and prayer, she attended promptly to every household duty, saying, \"A married woman must leave God at the altar to find Him in her domestic cares.\" Her ordinary food was bread and water, but she would bring sumptuous food to the poor and needy. During the invasion of Rome in 1413, Ponziano was banished. His estates were confiscated, his house was destroyed, and his eldest son taken hostage. St. Frances saw in these losses only the finger of God, and blessed His holy name. When peace was restored, Ponziano recovered his estate, and Frances founded the Oblates. After her husband's death, barefoot and with a cord about her neck, she sought admission to the community, and was soon elected Superioress. She was constanly aware of the presence of God, and amongst many visions was given sight of her guardian angel, who shed such brightness that the Saint could read her midnight Office. The Guardian Angel shielded her in the hour of temptation, and directed her in every good act. But when she was betrayed into some defect, he faded from her sight; and when some light words were spoken before her, he covered his face in shame. Sr. Frances passed way on March 9, 1440, on the day she had foretold. She was canonized in 1608 in recognition of her heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from her intercession.</p>"

She belonged to a non-believing and financially comfortable family and it seemed unlikely that she would trace a new spiritual path across the Church of France. Her father, follower of Voltaire and a liberal, was making his fortune in the banking world and in politics. Eugenie's mother provided the sensitive Eugenie with an education, which strengthened her character and gave her a strong sense of duty. Family life developed her intellectual curiosity and a romantic spirit, an interest in social questions and a broad world view. Like her contemporary, George Sand, Anne Eugenie went to Mass on feast days and received the Sacraments of initiation, as was the custom but without any real commitment. However, her First Communion was a great mystical experience that foretold the secret of her future. She did not grasp its prophetic meaning until much later when she recognized it as her path towards total belonging to Jesus Christ and the Church. Her youth was happy but not without suffering. She was affected when still a child by the death of an elder brother and a baby sister. Her health was delicate and a fall from a horse left serious consequences. Eugenie was mature for her age and learnt how to hide her feelings and to face up to events. Later, after a prosperous period for her father, she experienced the failure of his banks, the misunderstanding and eventual separation of her parents and the loss of all security. She had to leave her family home and go to Paris while Louis, closest to her in age and faithful companion went to live with their father. Eugenie went to Paris with the mother she adored, only to see her die from cholera after a few hours of illness, leaving her alone at the age of fifteen in a society that was worldly and superficial. Searching in anguish and almost desperate for the truth, she arrived at her conversion thirsty for the Absolute and open to the Transcendent. When she was nineteen, Anne Eugenie attended the Lenten Conferences at Notre Dame in Paris, preached by the young Abbe Lacordaire, already well-known for his talent as orator. Lacordaire was a former disciple of Lamennais ­- haunted by the vision of a renewed Church with a special place in the world. He understood his time and wanted to change it. He understood young people, their questions and their desires, their idealism and their ignorance of both Christ and the Church. His words touched Eugenie's heart, answered her many questions, and aroused her generosity. Eugenie envisaged Christ as the universal liberator and his kingdom on earth established as a peaceful and just society. I was truly converted, she wrote, and I was seized by a longing to devote all my strength or rather all my weakness to the Church which, from that moment, I saw as alone holding the key to the knowledge and achievement of all that is good. Just at this time, another preacher, also a former disciple of Lamennais, appeared on the scene. In the confessional, Father Combalot recognized that he had encountered a chosen soul who was designated to be the foundress of the Congregation he had dreamt of for a long time. He persuaded Eugenie to undertake his work by insisting that this Congregation was willed by God who had chosen her to establish it. He convinced her that only by education could she evangelize minds, make families truly Christian and thus transform the society of her time. Anne Eugenie accepted the project as God's will for her and allowed herself to be guided by the Abbe Combalot. At twenty-two, Marie Eugenie became foundress of the Religious of the Assumption, dedicated to consecrate their whole life and strength to extending the Kingdom of Christ in themselves and in the world. In 1839, Mademoiselle Eugenie Milleret, with two other young women, began a life of prayer and study in a flat at rue Ferou near the church of St. Sulpice in Paris. In 1841, under the patronage of Madame de Chateaubriand, Lacordaire, Montalembert and their friends, the sisters opened their first school. In a relatively short time there were sixteen sisters of four nationalities in the community. Marie Eugenie and the first sisters wanted to link the ancient and the new - to unite the past treasures of the Church's spirituality and wisdom with a type of religious life and education able to satisfy the demands of modern minds. It was a matter of respecting the values of the period and at the same time, making the Gospel values penetrate the rising culture of a new industrial and scientific era. The spirituality of the Congregation, centered on Christ and the Incarnation, was both deeply contemplative and dedicated to apostolic action. It was a life given to the search for God and the love and service of others. Marie Eugenie's long life covered almost the whole of the 19th century. She loved her times passionately and took an active part in their history. Progressively, she channeled all her energy and gifts in tending and extending the Congregation, which became her life work. God gave her sisters and many friends. One of the first sisters was Irish, a mystic and her intimate friend whom she called at the end of her life, \"half of myself.\" Kate O'Neill, called Mother Therese Emmanuel in religion, is considered as a co-foundress. Father Emmanuel d'Alzon, became Marie Eugenie's spiritual director soon after the foundation, was a father, brother or friend according to the seasons. In 1845, he founded the Augustinians of the Assumption and the two founders helped each other in a multitude of ways over a period of forty years. Both had a gift for friendship and they inspired many lay people to work with them and the Church. Together, as they followed Christ and labored with him, the religious and laity traced the path of the Assumption and took their place in the great cloud of witnesses. In the last years of her life, Mother Marie Eugenie experienced a progressive physical weakening, which she lived in silence and humility - a life totally centered on Christ. She received the Eucharist for the last time on March 9, 1898 and on the 10th, she gently passed over to the Lord. She was beatified by Pope Paul VI on February 9, 1975 and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on June 3, 2007 in Rome.</p><hr /><h3>The Forty Martyrs of Sebaste († c. 320)()</h3><hr /><p>THE FORTY MARTYRS OF SEBASTE ( c. 320) The forty martyrs were soldiers quartered at Sebaste in Armenia about the year 320. Their legion was ordered to offer pagan sacrifice, but they separated themselves from the rest with conscientious objection. As a secular punishment, the future martyrs were torn with scourges and iron hooks; chained together, and left to a lingering death. In the dead of winter, they were thrown naked onto the icy surface of a pond. With Christ so near them in the trial before death, they martyrs removed their own garments, and shambled, chained, toward the pond, singing hymns. In mockery of their faith, there were hot baths just nearby; but not one would renounce his faith. They remained steadfast, and passed away one by one. Among the Forty, there was a young soldier who held out the longest. When the officers came to cart away the bodies, they asked him to change his mind. But the soldier's mother encouraged him. He was able to make a sign of recognition before being carried away with hisbrothers.</p><hr /><h3>St. Macarius()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Our Saint was educated among the clergy of the Church of St. Zoilus, a martyr, who suffered with nineteen others under Diocletian. Here, he distinguished himself by his virtue and learning, and being ordained, was placed at the head of the chief ecclesiastical school at Cordova. He joined adoration, fasting and prayer to his studies; and his humility, mildness, and charity gained him affection and respect. During the persecution raised against the Christians in the year 850, St. Eulogius was thrown into prison, and there wrote his Exhortation to Martyrdom, addressed to the virgins Flora and Mary, who were beheaded the 24th of November, 851. Six days after their death, Eulogius was set at liberty. In the year 852, several others suffered similar martyrdom. St. Eulogius encouraged all these martyrs to their triumphs, and was the support of that distressed flock. A virgin, by name Leocritia, of a noble family among the Moors, had been instructed from her infancy in the Christian religion by one of her relatives, and privately baptized. Her father and mother used her very ill, and scourged her day and night to compel her to renounce the Faith. Having made her condition known to St. Eulogius and his sister Anulona, intimating that she desired to go where she might freely exercise her religion, they secretly procured her the means of getting away, and concealed her for some time among faithful friends. The matter was at length discovered, and they were all brought before the cadi, who threatened to have Eulogius scourged to death. The Saint told them that his torments would be of no avail, for he would never change his religion. Whereupon the cadi gave orders that he should be carried to the palace and be presented before the king's council. Eulogius began boldly to propose the truths of the Gospel to them. But, to prevent their hearing him, the council condemned him immediately to lose his head. As they were leading him to execution, one of the guards gave him a blow on the face for having spoken against Mahomet; he turned the other cheek, and patiently received a second. St. Eulogius received the stroke of death with great cheerfulness on March 11, 859. St. Leocritia was beheaded four days after him. Her body was thrown into the river Guadalquivir, but was recovered and buried by Christians.</p><hr /><h3>St. Oengus()</h3><hr />"

Do not the pagans do the same?<br />So be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Luigi Orione(Priest (1872-1940))</h3><p>Saint Luigi Orione Priest (1872-1940) St. Luigi Orione was born in Pontecurone, diocese of Tortona, on 23 June 1872. At thirteen years of age, he entered the Franciscan Friary of Voghera (Pavia), but he left after one year owing to poor health. From 1886 to 1889, he was a pupil of Saint John Bosco at the Valdocco Oratory (Youth Centre) in Turin. On October 16, 1889, he joined the diocesan seminary of Tortona. As a young seminarian, he devoted himself to the care of others by becoming a member of both the San Marziano Society for Mutual Help and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. On July 3, 1892, he opened the first Oratory in Tortona for the Christian formation of boys. The following year, on October 15, 1893, Luigi Orione, then a seminarian of twenty-one, started a boarding school for poor boys in the Saint Bernardine estate. On April 13, 1895, Luigi Orione was ordained, and on that occasion, the Bishop gave the clerical habit to six pupils of the boarding school. Within a brief span of time, Don Orione opened new houses at Mornico Losana (Pavia), Noto in Sicily, Sanremo and Rome. Around the young Founder, there grew up seminarians and priests who made up the first core group of the Little Work of Divine Providence. In 1899, he founded the branch of the Hermits of Divine Providence. The Bishop of Tortona, Mgr. Igino Bandi, by a Decree of March 21, 1903, issued the canonical approval of the Sons of Divine Providence (priests, lay brothers and hermits) - the male congregation of the Little Work of Divine Providence. It aims to \"co-operate to bring the little ones, the poor and the people, to the Church and to the Pope, by means of the works of charity,\" and professes a fourth vow of special \"faithfulness to the Pope.\" In the first Constitutions of 1904, among the aims of the new Congregation, there appears that of working to \"achieve the union of the separated Churches.\" Inspired by a profound love for the Church and for the salvation of Souls, he was actively interested in the new problems of his time, such as the freedom and unity of the Church, the Roman question, modernism, socialism and the Christian evangelization of industrial workers. He rushed to assist the victims of the earthquakes of Reggio and Messina (1908) and the Marsica region (1915). By appointment of Saint Pius X, he was made Vicar General of the diocese of Messina for three years. On June 29, 1915, twenty years after the foundation of the Sons of Divine Providence, he added to the \"single tree of many branches\" the Congregation of the Little Missionary Sisters of Charity who are inspired by the same founding charism. Alongside them, he placed the Blind Sisters, Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament. Later, the Contemplative Sisters of Jesus Crucified were also founded. For lay people, he set up the associations of the \"Ladies of Divine Providence,\" the \"Former Pupils,\" and the \"Friends\". More recently, the Don Orione Secular Institute and the Don Orione Lay People's Movement have come into being. Following the First World War (1914-1918), the number of schools, boarding houses, agricultural schools, charitable and welfare works increased. Among his most enterprising and original works, he set up the \"Little Cottolengos\" for the care of the suffering and abandoned, which were usually built on the outskirts of large cities to act as \"new pulpits\" from which to speak of Christ and of the Church - \"true beacons of faith and of civilization.\" Don Orione's missionary zeal, which had already manifested itself in 1913 when he sent his first religious to Brazil, expanded subsequently to Argentina and Uruguay (1921), Palestine (1921), Poland (1923), Rhodes (1925), the USA (1934), England (1935), Albania (1936). From 1921-1922 and from 1934-1937, he made two missionary journeys to Latin America: to Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, going as far as Chile. He enjoyed the personal respect of the Popes and the Holy See's Authorities, who entrusted him with confidential tasks of sorting out problems and healing wounds, both inside the Church in society. He was a preacher, a confessor and a tireless organiser of pilgrimages, missions, processions, live cribs and other popular manifestations and celebrations of the faith. He loved Our Lady deeply and fostered devotion to her by every means possible and, through the manual labour of his seminarians, built the shrines of Our Lady of Safe Keeping in Tortona and Our Lady of Caravaggio at Fumo. In the winter of 1940, with the intention of easing the heart and lung complaints that were troubling him, he went to the Sanremo house, even though, as he said, \"it is not among the palm trees that I would like to die, but among the poor who are Jesus Christ.\" Only three days later, on March 12, 1940, surrounded by his confreres, Don Orione passed away while sighing, \"Jesus, Jesus! I am going.\" St. Luigi's body was found uncorrupted at its first exhumation in 1965. It has been exposed to the veneration of the faithful in the shrine of Our Lady of Safe Keeping in Tortona ever since October 26, 1980 - the day in which Pope John Paul II inscribed Don Luigi Orione in the Book of the Blessed. He was canonized on May 16, 2004.</p><hr /><h3>St. Maximilian()</h3><hr />"

They fell silent and did not at that time tell anyone what they had seen.</p><hr /><h3>St. Euphrasia(Virgin and Martyr (+ 303))</h3><p>SAINT EUPHRASIA Virgin and Martyr(+ 303) The holy virgin Euphrasia lived in Nicomedia during the reign of Maximian. She was of noble origin, beautiful and virtuous, and faithfully served Jesus Christ. Idolaters seized her and demanded that she sacrifice to demons, but she refused. They flogged her mercilessly. However, they could not break her resolve.Finally, they turned her over to a barbarian, and he took her to his home, intending to rape her. On the way, Euphrasia prayed silently and ceaselessly to her most pure Bridegroom, Christ the Lord, beseeching Him to preserve her undefiled. Entering the house, Euphrasia asked the barbarian to wait a moment before ravishing her, because she wished to give him a plant with miraculous power.“If you wear this sprout on your person, no one can harm you,” she said.“Give it to me later,” he replied.“The plant is powerless if touched by a woman who has lost her virginity,” she explained. The barbarian agreed to let her go into the garden, where she broke off a sprig. She showed it to him, and he asked, “How will I know if you are telling the truth?”Euphrasia held the sprout against her neck and said: “Strike my neck with a two-handed sword as hard as you can. You will not harm me at all.” The barbarian fetched a sword and brought it down with all his might, decapitating her. Too late, the imbecile realized he had been outwitted, and gnashed his teeth furiously. The wise virgin, who preferred to die rather than be sullied, departed to her Bridegroom Christ.</p>"

Her parents placed her in the monastery of Erford while very young, of which her grandmother Maud was then abbess. Our Saint remained in that house, an accomplished model of all virtues, till her parents married her to Henry, son of Otho, Duke of Saxony, in 913, who was afterwards chosen king of Germany. He was a pious and victorious prince, and very tender toward his subjects. Whilst Henry, by his arms, checked the insolence of the Hungarians and Danes, and enlarged his dominions by adding to them Bavaria, Queen Maud gained domestic victories over her spiritual enemies more worthy of a Christian and far greater in the eyes of Heaven. She nourished the precious seeds of devotion and humility in her heart by assiduous prayer and meditation. It was her delight to visit, comfort, and exhort the sick and the afflicted; to serve and instruct the poor, and to afford her charitable succor to prisoners. King Henry, edified by her example, concurred with her in every pious undertaking. After twenty-three years' marriage, God was pleased to call King Henry to Himself in 936. Queen Maud, during his sickness, went to church pouring forth her soul in prayer at the foot of the altar. As soon as she understood, by the tears and cries of the people, that he had expired, she called for a priest that was fasting to offer the holy sacrifice for his soul. She had three sons: Otho, afterwards emperor; Henry, Duke of Bavaria; and St. Brunn, Archbishop of Cologne. Otho was crowned king of Germany in 937, and emperor at Rome in 962, after his victories over the Bohemians and Lombards. The two oldest sons conspired to strip Queen Maud of her dowry, on the unjust pretence that she had squandered the revenues of the state on the poor. The unnatural princes at length repented of their injustice, and restored to her all that had been taken from her.She then became more liberal in her alms than ever, and founded many churches, with five monasteries. In her last sickness, Queen Maud made her confession to her grandson William, the Archbishop of Mentz, who yet died twelve days before her, on his road home. She again made a public confession before the priests and monks of the place, received a second time the last sacraments, and, lying on a sack-cloth, with ashes on her head, passed away on March 14, 968.</p><hr /><h3>St. Leobinus()</h3><hr />"

He was a man of singular meekness and goodness. He loved the clergy and people of Rome to that degree that he hazarded his life for them on occasion of the troubles which Italy fell into by the rebellion of the Dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against King Luitprand. Out of respect to his sanctity and dignity, that king restored to the Church of Rome all the places which belonged to it, and sent back the captives without ransom. The Lombards were moved to tears at the devotion with which they heard him perform the divine service. The zeal and prudence of this holy Pope appeared in many wholesome regulations which he had made to reform or settle the discipline and peace of several churches. St. Boniface, the Apostle of Germany, wrote to him against a certain priest named Virgilius, who labored to sow the seeds of discord between him and Odilo, Duke of Bavaria, and taught many errors. Zachary ordered that Virgilius should be sent to Rome, that his doctrine might be examined. It seems that he cleared himself; for we find this same Virgilius soon after made Bishop of Salzburg. Certain Venetian merchants having bought at Rome many slaves to sell to the Moors in Africa, St. Zachary forbade such an iniquitous traffic, and, paying the merchants their price, gave the slaves their liberty. He adorned Rome with sacred buildings, and with great foundations in favor of the poor and pilgrims, and gave every year a considerable sum to furnish oil for the lamps in St. Peter's Church. He died in 752, in the month of March.</p><hr /><h3>St. Louise of Marillac (1591-1660)()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Louise of Marillac (1591-1660) St. Louise de Marillac was born in France, on August 12th, 1591. She was educated by the Dominican nuns at Poissy. She desired to become a nun, but on the advice of her confessor, she married Antony LeGras, an official in the Queen's service, in 1613. After Antony's death in 1625, Louise met St. Vincent de Paul, who became her spiritual adviser. She devoted the rest of her life to working with him. She helped direct his Ladies of Charity in their work of caring for the sick, the poor, and the neglected. In 1633, she set up a training center in her own home for candidates seeking to help in her work. This was the beginning of the Sisters (or Daughters, as Vincent preferred) of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul; though it was not formally approved until 1655. Sr. Louise took her vows in 1634 and attracted great numbers of candidates. She wrote a rule for the community, and in 1642, Vincent allowed four of the members to take vows. Formal approval placed the community under Vincent and his Congregation of the Missions, with Louise as Superior. Sr. Louise traveled all over France establishing her Sisters in hospitals, orphanages, and other institutions. Since then, the Congregation has spread all over the world. St. Louise of Marillac wascanonized by Pope Pius XI in 1934, and was declared Patroness of Social Workers by Pope John XXIII in 1960.</p>"

He was educated in the school of Worms Cathedral and at the Benedictine Gorze Abbey in Lorraine, France. He returned to Worms Cathedral to be provost and was ordained in 994. In the same year, Otto III appointed him chancellor for Italy and four years later also for Germany, a position which he held until Otto's death on January 23, 1002. Fr. Heribert was made an archbishop of Cologne on 998. Then, he also served Emperor St. Henry. Bp. Heribert built the monastery of Deutz, on the Rhine and performed miracles, including ending a drought. He is thus invoked for rains. He passed away in Cologne on March 16, 1021 and was buried at Deutz.He was already honoured as a saint during his lifetime, and was canonized by Pope St. Gregory VII about 1074.</p><hr /><h3>St. Abraham(Hermit & St. Mary (4th century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ABRAHAM, Hermit (+ c. 360) and SAINT MARY (+ c. 355) St. Abraham was a rich nobleman of Edessa. At his parents' desire, he married, but escaped to a cell near the city as soon as the feast was over. He walled up the door, leaving only a small window through which he received his food. There, for fifty years, he praised God and implored mercy for himself and for all men. The wealth which fell to him on his parents' death, he gave to the poor. Many sought Abraham for advice and consolation. Hence the Bishop of Edessa ordained Abraham a priest. Fr. Abraham was sent, soon after his ordination, to an idolatrous city which had hitherto been deaf to every messenger. He was insulted, beaten, and three times banished, but he returned each time with fresh zeal. For three years, he pleaded with God for those souls, and in the end prevailed. Every citizen came to him for Baptism. After providing for their spiritual needs, Fr. Abraham went back to his cell more than ever convinced of the power of prayer. His brother died, leaving an only daughter, Mary, to the Saint's care. He placed her in a cell near his own, and devoted himself to training her in perfection. After twenty years of innocence, Mary fell, and fled in despair to a distant city, where she drowned the voice of conscience in sin. Fr. Abraham and his friend, St. Ephrem, prayed earnestly for her during two years. Then he went disguised to seek the lost sheep, and had the joy of bringing her back to the desert a true penitent. Mary received the gift of miracles, and her countenance after death shone as the sun. St. Abraham passed away five years before her, about 360.

He was ordained to the priesthood by the bishop Fathlad. Fr. Finnian's holiness and the miracles wrought through his prayers drew many of the faithful to seek his assistance. When the mother of a leprous boy came to Finnian in the hope of a cure, the priest prayed intently for him. He then experienced a revelation that he could only obtain the child's healing by consenting to take the leprosy upon himself. Fr. Finnian readily accepted this sacrifice, and the boy was cured, while he himself became leprous from head to foot. Then, he was called Lobhar, \"the Leper\". After a stay in Clonmore, Fr. Finnian became abbot of Swords Abbey near Dublin. He may have returned to Clonmore in his later years. Fr. Finnian fell asleep in the Lord about the year 560. Tradition credits St. Finnian with founding a church at Innisfallen and a monastery there as well.</p>"

Dogs even used to come and lick his sores.<br />When the poor man died, he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried,<br />and from the netherworld, where he was in torment, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.<br />And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering torment in these flames.'<br />Abraham replied, 'My child, remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented.<br />Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours.'<br />He said, 'Then I beg you, father, send him to my father's house,<br />for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they too come to this place of torment.'<br />But Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'<br />He said, 'Oh no, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'<br />Then Abraham said, 'If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Patrick(Bishop (c. 385-461))</h3><p>SAINT PATRICKBishop, Apostle of Ireland(c. 385-461) If the virtue of children reflects an honor on their parents, the name of St. Patrick is illumined by the countless lights of sanctity from the Church of Ireland shines, and by the Saints she sent to many foreign countries. St. Patrick was born towards the close of the fourth century, in a village called Bonaven Taberniæ, which seems to be the town of Kilpatrick, on the mouth of the river Clyde, in Scotland, between Dumbarton and Glasgow. He calls himself both a Briton and a Roman, or of a mixed extraction, and says his father was of a good family named Calphurnius, and a denizen of a neighboring city of the Romans, who not long after abandoned Britain, in 409. Some writers call his mother Conchessa, and say she was niece to St. Martin of Tours. In his sixteenth year, St. Patrick he was carried into captivity by certain barbarians, who took him into Ireland, where he was obliged to keep cattle on the mountains and in the forests, in hunger and nakedness, amidst snow, rain, and ice. Whilst he lived in this suffering condition, God had pity on his soul, and quickened him to a sense of his duty by the impulse of a strong interior grace. The young man had recourse to God with his whole heart in fervent prayer and fasting; and from that time, faith and charity became ever stronger in his tender soul. After six years spent in slavery under the same master, St. Patrick was admonished by God in a dream to return to his own country, and informed that a ship was then ready to sail thither. He went at once to the sea-coast, though at a great distance, and found the vessel; but could not obtain his passage, probably for want of money. The Saint returned, praying as he went; but the sailors, though pagans, called him back and took him on board. After three days’ sail they made land, but wandered twenty-seven days through deserts, and were a long while distressed for want of provisions, finding nothing to eat. Patrick had often spoken to the company on the infinite power of God; they therefore asked him why he did not pray for relief. Animated by a strong faith, he assured them that if they would address themselves with their whole hearts to the true God He would hear and succor them. They did so, and on the same day met with a herd of swine. From that time provisions never failed them, till on the twenty-seventh day they came into a country that was cultivated and inhabited. Some years afterwards he was again led captive, but recovered his liberty after two months. When he was at home with his parents, God manifested to him, by visions, the great work of the conversion of Ireland. The writers of his life say that after his second captivity he travelled into Gaul and Italy, and saw St. Martin, St. Germanus of Auxerre, and Pope Celestine, and received his apostolical benediction from this Pope, who passed away in 432. It is certain that St. Patrick spent many years preparing himself for his sacred calling. Great opposition was made against his episcopal consecration and mission, both by his own relatives and by the clergy. These made him great offers in order to detain him among them, and endeavored to affright him by exaggerating the dangers to which he exposed himself amidst the enemies of the Romans and Britons, who did not know God. All these temptations threw the Saint into great perplexities; but the Lord, Whose will he consulted by earnest prayer, supported him, and he persevered in his resolution. He forsook his family and sold his birthright and dignity to serve strangers, and consecrated his soul to God to carry His name to the ends of the earth. In this disposition, he passed into Ireland, to preach the Gospel where the worship of idols still generally reigned. He devoted himself entirely to the salvation of these nations. He travelled over the whole island, penetrating into the remotest corners, and such was the fruit of his preachings and sufferings that he baptized an infinite number of people. He ordained everywhere clergymen, induced women to live in holy widowhood and continence, consecrated virgins to Christ, and instituted monks. He took nothing from the many thousands whom he baptized, and often gave back the little presents which some laid on the altar, choosing rather to mortify the fervent than to scandalize the weak. He gave freely of his own, however, both to pagans and Christians, distributed large alms to the poor in the provinces where he passed, made presents to the kings, judging that necessary for the progress of the Gospel, and maintained and educated many children, whom he trained up to serve at the altar. The happy success of his labors cost him many persecutions. A certain prince named Corotick, a Christian in name only, disturbed the peace of his flock. This tyrant, having made a descent into Ireland, plundered the country where St. Patrick had been just conferring confirmation on a great number of neophytes, who were yet in their white garments after Baptism. Corotick massacred many, and carried away others, whom he sold to the Picts or Scots. The next day, the Saint sent Corotick a letter entreating him to restore the Christian captives, and at least part of the booty he had taken, that the poor people might not perish for want, but he was rebuffed. The Saint, therefore, wrote another letter, styling himself a sinner and an ignorant man, but declared, nevertheless, that he is established Bishop of Ireland, and pronounced Corotick and the other parricides and accomplices separated from him and from Jesus Christ, forbidding any to eat with them, or to receive their alms, till they should have satisfied God by the tears of sincere penance, and restored the servants of Jesus Christ to their liberty. This letter expressed his most tender love for his flock, and his grief for those who had been slain, yet mingled with joy because they reign with the prophets, apostles, and martyrs. Jocelin assures us that Corotick was overtaken by the divine vengeance. St. Patrick held several councils to settle the discipline of the Church which he had planted. St. Bernard and the tradition of the country testify that St. Patrick fixed his metropolitan see at Armagh. He established some other bishops, as appears by his Council and other monuments. He not only converted the whole country by his preaching and wonderful miracles, but also cultivated this vineyard with so fruitful a benediction and increase from heaven as to render Ireland a most flourishing garden in the Church of God, and a country of Saints. Many particulars are related of the labors of St. Patrick, which we pass over. In the first year of his mission, he attempted to preach Christ in the general assembly of the kings and states of all Ireland, held yearly at Tara, the residence of the chief king, styled the monarch of the whole island, and the principal seat of the Druids, or priests, and their paganish rites. The son of Neill, the chief monarch, declared himself against the preacher; however, Patrick converted several, and, on his road to that place, the father of St. Benignus, his immediate successor in the see of Armagh. He afterwards converted and baptized the Icings of Dublin and Munster, and the seven sons of the king of Connaught, with the greatest part of their subjects, and before his death, almost the whole island. He founded a monastery at Armagh; another called Domnach-Padraig, or Patrick's Church; also a third, named Sabhal-Padraig; and filled the country with churches and schools of piety and learning, the reputation of which, for the three succeeding centuries, drew many foreigners into Ireland. He died and was buried at Down in Ulster. His body was found there in a church of his name in 1185, and translated to another part of the same church. Ireland is the nursery whence St. Patrick sent forth his missionaries and teachers. Glastonbury and Lindisfarne, Ripon and Malmesbury, bear testimony to the labors of Irish priests and bishops for the conversion of England. Iona is to this day the most venerated spot in Scotland. Columban, Fiacre, Gall, and many others evangelized the \"rough places\" of France and Switzerland. America and Australia, in modern times, owe their Christianity to the faith and zeal of the sons and daughters of St. Patrick.</p>"

Get ready; I will send you to them.\" \"I am ready,\" Joseph answered.<br />The man told him, \"They have moved on from here; in fact, I heard them say, 'Let us go on to Dothan.'\" So Joseph went after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan.<br />They noticed him from a distance, and before he came up to them, they plotted to kill him.<br />They said to one another: \"Here comes that master dreamer!<br />Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns here; we could say that a wild beast devoured him. We shall then see what comes of his dreams.\"<br />When Reuben heard this, he tried to save him from their hands, saying: \"We must not take his life.<br />Instead of shedding blood,\" he continued, \"just throw him into that cistern there in the desert; but don't kill him outright.\" His purpose was to rescue him from their hands and restore him to his father.<br />So when Joseph came up to them, they stripped him of the long tunic he had on;<br />then they took him and threw him into the cistern, which was empty and dry.<br />They then sat down to their meal. Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, their camels laden with gum, balm and resin to be taken down to Egypt.<br />Judah said to his brothers: \"What is to be gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood?<br />Rather, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites, instead of doing away with him ourselves. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh.\" His brothers agreed.<br />They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. Some Midianite traders passed by, and they pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and took him to Egypt.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>105(104),16-17.18-19.20-21.</em><p>When the LORD called down a famine on the land <br />and ruined the crop that sustained them,<br />He sent a man before them, <br />Joseph, sold as a slave.<br />They had weighed him down with fetters, <br />and he was bound with chains,<br />Till his prediction came to pass <br />and the word of the LORD proved him true.<br />The king sent and released him, <br />the ruler of the peoples set him free.<br />He made him lord of his house <br />and ruler of all his possessions.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>21,33-43.45-46.</em><p>Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: \"Hear another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.<br />When vintage time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce.<br />But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat, another they killed, and a third they stoned.<br />Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones, but they treated them in the same way.<br />Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, 'They will respect my son.'<br />But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.'<br />They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.<br />What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?\"<br />They answered him, \"He will put those wretched men to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the proper times.\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"Did you never read in the scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; by the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes'?<br />Therefore, I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit.<br />When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them.<br />And although they were attempting to arrest him, they feared the crowds, for they regarded him as a prophet.</p><hr /><h3>St. Cyril of Jerusalem(Doctor of the Church (+386))</h3><p>ST. CYRIL OF JERUSALEMBishop and Doctor of the Church(+386) Cyril was born at or near Jerusalem about the year 315. He was ordained by St. Maximus, who gave him the important charge of instructing and preparing the candidates for Baptism. This charge he held for several years, and we still have one series of his instructions, given in the year 347 or 348. They are of singular interest as being the earliest record of the systematic teaching of the Church on the creed and sacraments, and as having been given in the church built by Constantine on Mount Calvary. They are solid, simple, profound; saturated with Holy Scripture; exact, precise, and terse; and, as a witness and exposition of the Catholic faith, invaluable. On the death of St. Maximus, Cyril was chosen Bishop of Jerusalem. At the beginning of his episcopate, a cross was seen in the air reaching from Mount Calvary to Mount Olivet, and so bright that it shone at noonday. Cyril gave an account of it to the emperor; and the faithful regarded it as a presage of victory over the Arian heretics. While Cyril was bishop, the apostate Julian resolved to falsify the words of Our Lord by rebuilding the Temple at Jerusalem. He employed the power and resources of a Roman emperor. The Jews thronged enthusiastically to Julian and gave munificently. But Cyril was unmoved. \"The word of God abides,\" he said; \"one stone shall not be laid on another.\" When the attempt was made, a secular writer tells us that horrible flames came forth from the earth, rendering the place inaccessible to the scorched and scared workmen. The attempt was made again and again, and then abandoned in despair. Soon after, the emperor perished in a war against the Persians. Like the other great bishops of his time, Cyril was persecuted, and driven again and again from his see; but on the death of the Arian Emperor Valens, he returned to Jerusalem. He was present at the second General Council at Constantinople, and died in peace in 386 after a troubled episcopate of thirty-five years.</p>"

Marcel Callo (1921-1945)()</h3><p>Blessed Marcel Callo (1921-1945) Marcel Callo was born on December 6, 1921 in Rennes, France, being one of nine children. He was a happy child, known to be a leader and a perfectionist. After completing his primary studies, he became an apprentice to a printer around age 13. He belonged to the JOC (Young Christian Worker). On March 8, 1943, World War II had gripped their city of Rennes. That day, his sister, Madeleine, was killed by one of the bombs that leveled her building. When the Nazis later occupied France, Marcel was deported to Zella-Mehlis, Nazi Germany to the S.T.O. (Service of Obligatory Work). If he did not comply, his family would be arrested, so he went. Once there, he worked in a factory that produced bombs. After three months or so of missing his family and missing Mass (there was no Catholic church in that town), Marcel became seriously depressed. He later found a room where Mass was offered on Sunday. This helped change his disposition. He reported that, \"Finally Christ reacted. He made me to understand that the depression was not good. I had to keep busy with my friends and then joy and relief would come back to me.\" With his morale and hope restored, he cared for his deported friends. He organized a group of Christian workers who did activities together like play sports or cards. He also organized a theatrical group. He galvanized his friends despite him suffering from painful boils, headaches and infected teeth. For his French friends, he arranged a Mass to be celebrated in their native tongue. Eventually, his religious activities attracted unwanted attention from Nazi officials. The Nazis arrested Marcel on April 19, 1944. The Nazis interrogated Marcel. He admitted his Catholic activities and was imprisoned in Gotha. He secretly received the Eucharist while in prison and continued to pray and help his companions. He was considered dangerous to the Nazis and was moved to a different prison at Mathausen. He suffered from various ailments such as bronchitis, malnutrition, dysentery, fever, swelling, and generalized weakness. He never complained. Despite his suffering, he encouraged his companions by saying, \"It is in prayer that we find our strength.\" Bl. Marcel Callo passed away on the feast of St. Joseph, March 19, 1945. Pope John Paul II beatified him on October 4, 1987.</p>"

Leading the flock across the desert, he came to Horeb, the mountain of God.<br />There an angel of the LORD appeared to him in fire flaming out of a bush. As he looked on, he was surprised to see that the bush, though on fire, was not consumed.<br />So Moses decided, \"I must go over to look at this remarkable sight, and see why the bush is not burned.\"<br />When the LORD saw him coming over to look at it more closely, God called out to him from the bush, \"Moses! Moses!\" He answered, \"Here I am.\"<br />God said, \"Come no nearer! Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.<br />I am the God of your father,\" he continued, \"the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.\" Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.<br />But the LORD said, \"I have witnessed the affliction of my people in Egypt and have heard their cry of complaint against their slave drivers, so I know well what they are suffering.<br />Therefore I have come down to rescue them from the hands of the Egyptians and lead them out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the country of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.<br />\"But,\" said Moses to God, \"when I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' if they ask me, 'What is his name?' what am I to tell them?\"<br />God replied, \"I am who am.\" Then he added, \"This is what you shall tell the Israelites: I AM sent me to you.\"<br />God spoke further to Moses, \"Thus shall you say to the Israelites: The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. \"This is my name forever; this is my title for all generations.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>103(102),1-2.3-4.6-7.8.11.</em><p>Bless the LORD, O my soul; <br />and all my being, bless his holy name.<br />Bless the LORD, O my soul, <br />and forget not all his benefits.<br />He pardons all your iniquities, <br />he heals all your ills.<br />He redeems your life from destruction, <br />he crowns you with kindness and compassion.<br />The LORD secures justice <br />and the rights of all the oppressed.<br />He has made known his ways to Moses, <br />and his deeds to the children of Israel.<br />Merciful and gracious is the LORD, <br />slow to anger and abounding in kindness.<br />For as the heavens are high above the earth, <br />so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.</p><h3>First Letter to the Corinthians</h3><em>10,1-6.10-12.</em><p>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea,<br />and all of them were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.<br />All ate the same spiritual food,<br />and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was the Christ.<br />Yet God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the desert.<br />These things happened as examples for us, so that we might not desire evil things, as they did.<br />Do not grumble as some of them did, and suffered death by the destroyer.<br />These things happened to them as an example, and they have been written down as a warning to us, upon whom the end of the ages has come.<br />Therefore, whoever thinks he is standing secure should take care not to fall.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>13,1-9.</em><p>Some people told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with the blood of their sacrifices.<br />He said to them in reply, \"Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way they were greater sinners than all other Galileans?<br />By no means!

Having finished elementary school at Wilamowic and Kęty, he attended high school at Wadowice, receiving his diploma in 1880. On July 6, 1884 he was ordained in Krakow by Cardinal Albino Dunajewski. In 1886, he received a Doctorate in Theology from the University of Vienna. Following advanced studies in Rome and Paris, he passed the qualifying exam at the Jaghellonic University of Krakow. The following year, he became professor of Dogmatic Theology at the John Casimir University of Leopoli. He also served as Dean of Theology prior to becoming Rector of the University. During his tenure at the University, he was appreciated as a professor by his students and also enjoyed the friendship and respect of his colleagues. He arduously dedicated himself to scientific work and, despite his young age, acquired notoriety as a learned man. His extraordinary intellectual and relational abilities were recognized by Francis Joseph, the Emperor of Austria, who presented Monsignor Joseph to the Holy Father as a candidate for the vacant Metropolitan See of Leopoli. The holy father, Leo XIII, responded positively to the Emperor's proposal; and on December 17, 1900, he named the forty year old Monsignor Joseph Bilczewski Archbishop of Leopoli of the Latin Rite.Given the complex social, economic, ethnic and religious situation, care for the large diocese required of the Bishop a deep commitment and called for great moral effort, strong confidence in God, and a faith enlivened by a continual contact with God. Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski became known for his abundant goodness of heart, understanding, humility, piety, commitment to hard work and pastoral zeal which sprang from his immense love for God and neighbor.Upon taking possession of the Archdiocese of Leopoli he spelled out very clearly his pastoral plan which can be summed up in the words \"totally sacrifice oneself for the Holy Church\". Among other things he pointed out the need for the development of devotion to the Most Blessed Sacrament and frequent reception of Holy Communion. A particular form of pastoral action of Archbishop Bilczewski were the pastoral letters and appeals addressed to the priests and the faithful of the Archdiocese. In them, he spoke of the problems of faith and morals of the time as well as of the most pressing issues of the social sphere. He also explained devotion to the Eucharist and to the Sacred Heart in them and the importance of religious and moral formation of children and youth in the family and in school. He taught for the Church and for the Holy Father. Above all, he took great care to cultivate many priestly vocations. He saw the priest as first and foremost a teacher of faith and an instrument of Christ, a father for the rich as well as for the poor. Taking the place of Christ on Earth, the priest was to be the minister of the Sacraments, and for this reason his whole heart had to be dedicated to the celebration of the Eucharist, nourishing the people of God with the body of Christ (Jn 6:55). He often exhorted the priests to adoration of the most Blessed Sacrament. In his pastoral letter devoted to the Eucharist, he invited the priests to participate in the priestly associations: The Association for Perpetual Adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament and the Association of Aid to Poor Catholic Churches whose goal was to rejuvenate the zeal of the priests themselves. He also dedicated a great deal of care to the preparation of children and to full participation in the Mass, desiring that every Catechesis would lead children and youth to the Eucharist. Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski promoted the construction of churches and chapels, schools and day-care centers. He developed teaching to help enable the growth in the instruction of the faithful. He materially and spiritually helped the more important works which were springing up in his Archdiocese. His holy life, filled with prayer, work and works of mercy led to his meriting great appreciation and respect on the part of those of various faiths, rites and nationalities present in the Archdiocese. No religious or nationalistic conflicts arose during the tenure of his pastoral work. He was a proponent of unity, harmony and peace. On social issues he always stood on the side of the people and of the poor. He taught that the base of social life had to be justice made perfect by Christian love. During the First World War, when souls were overtaken with hate and a lack of appreciation of the other, he pointed out to the people the infinite love of God, capable of forgiving every type of sin and offense. He reminded them of the need to observe the commandments of God and particularly that of brotherly love. Sensitive to the social questions regarding the family and youth, he courageously proposed solutions to problems based on the love of God and of neighbor. During his 23 years of pastoral service, he changed the face of the Archdiocese of Leopoli. Only his death on March 20, 1923 could end his vast and far-sighted pastoral action. He was prepared for death and accepted it with peace and submission as a sign of God's will, which he always considered sacred.He left this world having enjoyed a universal recognition of holiness. Wanting to rest among those for whom he was always father and protector, in accord with his desires, he was buried in Leopoli in the cemetery of Janów, known as the cemetery of the poor. Thanks to the efforts of the Archdiocese of Leopoli, the process for his beatification and canonization was initiated. The first step was concluded on December 17, 1997 with the declaration of the life of heroic virtue of Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski by The Holy Father, Pope John Paul II. In June 2001, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints recognized as miraculous the fact of the rapid lasting and unexplainable \"quo ad modum\" healing through the intercession of Archbishop Bilczewski of the third degree burns of Marcin Gawlik, a nine year old boy, thus opening the way for his beatification.The beatification took place in the Diocese of Leopoli on June 26, 2001 during Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Visit to the Ukraine.He was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 23, 2005 at Rome.</p><hr /><h3>St. Maria Josefa of the Heart of Jesus((1842-1912))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARIA JOSEFA OF THE HEART OF JESUS SANCHO DE GUERRA Religious (1842-1912)I- LIFE AND WORKS Saint Maria Josefa of the Heart of Jesus, eldest daughter of Bernabe Sancho, chair-maker, and of Petra de Guerra, housewife, was born in Vitoria (Spain) on September 7, 1842, and was baptized the following day. According to the custom practiced then, she was confirmed two years after, on August 10, 1844. Her father died when she was seven years old; her mother prepared her for the First Communion that she received at ten years old. At the age of fifteen she was sent to Madrid to some relatives to receive education and a more complete formation. The characteristic traits of her infancy and childhood were: a strong piety to the Eucharist and the Virgin Mary, a remarkable sensibility towards the poor and the sick and an inclination to solitude. She returned to Vitoria at the age of eighteen and manifested to her mother the desire to enter in a monastery, feeling an attraction to the cloistered life. From adulthood, Blessed Maria Josefa used to repeat: \"I was born with a religious vocation.\" She lived through many various experiences, but listened faithfully to counsel from both priests and family, before finding the definitive form of her vocation. She was, in fact, to be on the point of entering to the Conceptionists contemplative of Aranjuez in 1860, but was prevented by the occurrence of a grave sickness of typhus. Her mother helped her to overcome the disappointment. In the succeeding months, it seemed to her understanding that the Lord calls her to a type of religious active life. For this, she decided to enter in the Institute of the Servants of Mary, recently founded in Madrid by Saint Soledad Torres Acosta. With the coming of the time of her profession, she was assailed with grave doubts and uncertainty on her effective call in that Institute. She opened her soul to various confessors and from their advices she felt that she was mistaken on her vocation. The meetings with the holy Archbishop Claret and the serene conversations with the same Saint Soledad Torres Acosta, gradually arrived to the decision of leaving the Institute of the Servants of Mary to give life to a new religious family, that had for its aim the exclusive assistance to the sick in the hospitals and in their homes. Sharing this same ideal with three other Servants of Mary, who with the permission of Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo, went out together with her with the same purpose. The new foundation was made in Bilbao in the spring of 1871, when Maria Josefa was twenty nine years old. Since then, and for the succeeding forty one years, she was superior of the new Institute of the Servants of Jesus. She embarked on difficult trips to visit the different communities until a long sickness confined her in the house of Bilbao. Obliged to stay on bed or in an armchair, she continued to follow the events of the various communities with in and outside Spain through a painstaking and precious correspondence. On her death, on March 20, 1912, which happened after long years of suffering, there were 43 houses founded and the number of her Sisters reached more than one thousand. Her holy death caused great impact to Bilbao and in other numerous localities where she was known through the houses of her Institute. In the same way, her funeral had an extraordinary resonance. She was buried in the municipal cemetery of Bilbao. In 1926, her fame of sanctity grew and her mortal remains were transferred to the Mother House of the Institute and have been buried in the chapel until now.II- SPIRITUALITY The writings and the testimonies of the eye-witnesses put in evidence the central points of the spirituality of Blessed Maria Josefa:1) Great love to the Eucharist and to the Sacred Heart.2) Profound adoration to the mystery of Redemption and intimate participation to the sufferings of Christ and to his Cross.3) Total dedication to the service of the sick in a context of contemplative spirit. Here are some significant expressions taken from her writings: \"The charity and mutual love constitute even in this life the paradise of the community. Without cross we cannot live wherever we go, because the religious life is a life of sacrifice and of abnegation. The foundation of greatest perfection is the fraternal charity.\"(Don Pablo B. Aristegui, Beata Maria Josefa del Cuore di Gesù, Mensajero, Bilbao, 1992, p. 97). \"Don't believe sisters that the assistance consists only in giving medicines and food to the sick. There is another type of assistance that must never be forgotten and it is the assistance of the heart that adjusts and enter in sympathy with the person who suffers and go to meet his necessities.\" (Ibidem, p. 100). \"We form in the Divine Heart of Jesus our center to communicate with Him. We can do it with the frequency that we desire without fear of molesting anyone; only with Jesus will be our intimacy.'' (Consejos y Maximas de Nuestra Venerada Madre Fundadora. Madrid, Imprenta Juan Bravo, 1994, p. 15).III- CHARISM TO SERVE THE SICK The particular footprint imprinted by Ma. Josefa to the Institute of the Servants of Jesus reflects her interior experience of a soul consecrated to the charitable service of the neighbor, especially to the sick, in a climate of contemplative spirit. We find her concept well-expressed in the Directorio de Asistencias, written by herself, where it is understood and affirmed what the Servant of Jesus provide for the sick, that she accompanies until the door of eternity, a blessing better than that of a missionary who with his preaching call those who are lost to the right path of life. \"In this manner, as written in the functional manuals of our Institute, designed to procure the corporal health of the neighbor, is elevated to a great height, making our active life more perfect than that of a contemplative, as taught by the angelic teacher St. Thomas who says about the works directed to the salvation of souls derived from contemplation.\" (Directorio de Asistencias de la Congregación Religiosas Siervas de Jesús de la Caridad, Vitoria, 1930, p. 9). With this spirit, the Servants of Jesus, from the death of their Mother Maria Josefa and until now, have continued their service to the sick, with a generous oblation of life which reminds that of their Foundress. Furthermore, in conformity to the progress of times and the necessities of the modern life, from the primary end of the assistance to the sick, the assistance to old persons in residences and the reception and assistance to the children in day care centers, some others were added, such as: provision of food to the indigents, centers for those afflicted with AIDS, day care centers for the aged, pastoral health care and other works of beneficence and charities, above all in the poorest places of Latin America and Asia. Today, in actuality, the 1,050 Religious of the Institute of the Servants of Jesus are present in Spain and in other countries such as Italy, France, Portugal, Chile, Argentina, Columbia, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Dominican Republic, Paraguay and Philippines.IV- ITINERARY OF THE CAUSE Few years after the death of Mother Maria Josefa, the Institute of the Servants of Jesus planned to start the Cause of the Canonization, but because of the adverse circumstances due to the Spanish civil war of 1936 and the Second World War, was able to realize the plan only after almost thirty years.a) On May 31, 1951, was the start of the Informative Ordinary Process in Bilbao.b) On January 7, 1972 the Decretum super introductione Causae.c) On September 7, 1989 was promulgated the Decretum super Virtutibus.d) On September 27, 1992 she was solemnly beatified in Saint Peter's Square.e) On October 1, 2000 she was canonized by John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Wulfran(Archbishop (+720))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT WULFRAN Archbishop(+720) St. Wulfran's father was an officer in the armies of King Dagobert. He spent some years in the court of King Clotaire III and the king's mother, St. Bathildes. St. Wulfran was humble and deeply in love with Jesus Christ and Mama Mary. Through prayer and the Sacraments, he learned to overcome concupiscence and the vanities of the world. Wulfran wasconsecrated Archbishop of Sens in 682. He governed the diocese for two and a half years with great zeal and humility. A tender compassion for the blindness of idolaters in Friesland, and the example of zealous English preachers, moved him to resign his bishopric, seek advice in a retreat at Fontenelle, and enter Friesland as a poor missionary priest. He baptized multitudes, among them a son of King Radbod, and drew the people from their custom of sacrificing people to idols. On a certain occasion, Ovon having been selected as a victim of a sacrifice to devils, St. Wulfran earnestly begged his life of King Radbod; but the people ran tumultuously to the palace, and would not suffer what they called a sacrilege. After many words, they consented, but on condition that Wulfran's God should save Ovon's life. The Saint betook himself to prayer; the man, after hanging on the gibbet two hours, and being left for dead, fell to the ground by the breaking of the cord; being found alive he was given to the Saint, and became a monk and priest at Fontenelle. St. Wulfran also miraculously rescued two children from being drowned in honor of idols. Radbod, who had been an eye-witness to this last miracle, promised to become a Christian; but as he was going to step into the baptismal font, he asked where the great number of his ancestors and nobles were in the next world. The prince then refused to be baptized, and passed away before St. Willibrord could entreat him to conversion. Shortly after, St. Wulfran retired to Fontenelle to prepare himself for death; and passed away on April 20, 720.</p>"

But valiant as he was, the man was a leper.<br />Now the Arameans had captured from the land of Israel in a raid a little girl, who became the servant of Naaman's wife.<br />\"If only my master would present himself to the prophet in Samaria,\" she said to her mistress, \"he would cure him of his leprosy.\"<br />Naaman went and told his lord just what the slave girl from the land of Israel had said.<br />\"Go,\" said the king of Aram. \"I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.\" So Naaman set out, taking along ten silver talents, six thousand gold pieces, and ten festal garments.<br />To the king of Israel he brought the letter, which read: \"With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.\"<br />When he read the letter, the king of Israel tore his garments and exclaimed: \"Am I a god with power over life and death, that this man should send someone to me to be cured of leprosy? Take note! You can see he is only looking for a quarrel with me!\"<br />When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent word to the king: \"Why have you torn your garments? Let him come to me and find out that there is a prophet in Israel.\"<br />Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.<br />The prophet sent him the message: \"Go and wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will heal, and you will be clean.\"<br />But Naaman went away angry, saying, \"I thought that he would surely come out and stand there to invoke the LORD his God, and would move his hand over the spot, and thus cure the leprosy.<br />Are not the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be cleansed?\" With this, he turned about in anger and left.<br />But his servants came up and reasoned with him. \"My father,\" they said, \"if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary, would you not have done it? All the more now, since he said to you, 'Wash and be clean,' should you do as he said.\"<br />So Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times at the word of the man of God. His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.<br />He returned with his whole retinue to the man of God. On his arrival he stood before him and said, \"Now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>42(41),2-3.43(42),3-4.</em><p>As the hind longs for the running waters, <br />so my soul longs for you, O God.<br />Athirst is my soul for God, the living God. <br />When shall I go and behold the face of God?<br />Send forth your light and your fidelity; <br />they shall lead me on <br />And bring me to your holy mountain, <br />to your dwelling place.<br />Then will I go in to the altar of God, <br />the God of my gladness and joy; <br />Then will I give you thanks upon the harp, <br />O God, my God!</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>4,24-30.</em><p>Jesus said to the people in the synagogue at Nazareth: \"Amen, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own native place.<br />Indeed, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was closed for three and a half years and a severe famine spread over the entire land.<br />It was to none of these that Elijah was sent, but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon.<br />Again, there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.\"<br />When the people in the synagogue heard this, they were all filled with fury.<br />They rose up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town had been built, to hurl him down headlong.<br />But he passed through the midst of them and went away.</p><hr /><h3>St. Benedetta Cambiagio Frassinello (1791-1858)()</h3><p>SAINT BENEDETTA CAMBIAGIO FRASSINELLO (1791 - 1858) Saint Benedetta Cambiagio Frasinello was born on 2 October 1791 in Langasco (Genoa) Italy; she died on 21 March 1858 in Ronco Scrivia in Liguria. She was wife, religious and foundress. She let the Holy Spirit guide her through married life to the work of education and religious consecration. She founded a school for the formation of young women and also a religious congregation, and did both with the generous collaboration of her husband. This is unique in the annals of Christian sanctity. Benedetta was a pioneer in her determination to give a high quality education to young women, for the formation of families for a \"new Christian society\" and for promoting the right of women to a complete education.Call to marriage, then to religious life From her parents Benedetta received a Christian formation that rooted in her the life of faith. Her family settled in Pavia when she was a girl. When she was 20 years old, Benedetta had a mystical experience that gave her a profound desire for a life of prayer and penance, and of consecration to God. However, in obedience to the wishes of her parents, in 1816, she married Giovanni Frassinello and lived married life for two years. In 1818, moved by the example of his saintly wife, Giovanni agreed that the two should live chastely, \"as brother and sister\" and take care of Benedetta's younger sister, Maria, who was dying from intestinal cancer. They began to live a supernatural parenthood quite unique in the history of the Church.Congregation founded by wife, who is supported by her husband Following Maria's death in 1825, Giovanni entered the Somaschi Fathers founded by St Jerome Emiliani, and Benedetta devoted herself completely to God in the Ursuline Congregation of Capriolo. A year later she was forced to leave because ofill health, and returned to Pavia where she was miraculously cured by St Jerome Emiliani. Once she regained her health, with the Bishop's approval, she dedicated herself to the educationofyounggirls.Benedetta needed help in handling such a responsibility, but her own father refused to help her. Bishop Tosi of Pavia asked Giovanni to leave the Somaschi novitiate and help Benedetta in her apostolic work. Together they made a vow of perfect chastity in the hands of the bishop, and then began their common work to promote the human and Christian formation of poor and abandoned girls of the city. Their educational work was of great benefit to Pavia. Benedetta became the first woman to be involved in this kind of work. The Austrian government recognized her as a \"Promoter of Public Education\". She was helped by young women volunteers to whom she gave a rule of life that later received ecclesiastical approval. Along with instruction, she joined formation in catechesis and in useful skills like cooking and sewing, aiming to transform her students into \"models of Christian life\" and so assure the formation of families.Benedictine Sisters of Providence Benedetta's work was considered pioneering for those days and was opposed by a few persons in power and by the misunderstanding of clerics. In 1838 she turned over the institution to the Bishop of Pavia. Together with Giovanni and five companions, she moved to Ronco Scrivia in the Genoa region. There they opened a school for girls that was a refinement on what they had done in Pavia. Eventually, Benedetta founded the Congregation of the Benedictine Sisters of Providence. In her rule she stressed the education of young girls. She instilled the spirit of unlimited confidence and abandonment to Providence and of love of God through poverty and charity. The Congregation grew quickly since it performed a needed service. Benedetta was able to guide the development of the Congregation until her death. On 21 March 1858 she died in Ronco Scrivia. Her example is that of supernatural maternity plus courage and fidelity in discerning and living God's will. Today the Benedictine Nuns of Providence are present in Italy, Spain, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Peru and Brazil. They are at the service of young people, the poor, the sick and the elderly. The foundress also opened a house of the order in Voghera. Forty years after the death of Benedetta, the bishop separated this house from the rest of the Order. The name was changed to the Benedictines of Divine Providence who honour the memory of the Foundress. She was canonized by John Paul II on May 19, 2002.</p><hr /><h3>St. Euda()</h3><hr />"

Cardinal August von Galen(Bishop (1933-1946))</h3><p>Blessed Clemens August von GalenBishop of Münster (1878-1946) Clemens August von Galen was born on 16 March 1878 in Dinklage Castle, Oldenburg, Germany, the 11th of 13 children born to Count Ferdinand Heribert and Elisabeth von Spees. His father belonged to the noble family of Westphalia, who since 1660 governed the village of Dinklage. For over two centuries his ancestors carried out the inherited office of camerlengo of the Diocese of Münster. Clemens August grew up in Dinklage Castle and in other family seats. Due to the struggle between Church and State, he and his brothers were sent to a school run by the Jesuits in Feldkirch, Austria. He remained there until 1894, when he transferred to the Antonianum in Vechta. After graduation, he studied philosophy and theology in Frebur, Innsbruck and Münster, and was ordained a priest on 28 May 1904 for the Diocese of Münster by Bishop Hermann Dingelstadt.Parish priest, concern for poor His first two years as a priest were spent as vicar of the diocesan cathedral where he became chaplain to his uncle, Bishop Maximilian Gerion von Galen. From 1906 to 1929, Fr von Galen carried out much of his pastoral activity outside Münster: in 1906 he was made chaplain of the parish of St Matthias in Berlin-Schönberg; from 1911 to 1919 he was curate of a new parish in Berlin before becoming parish priest of the Basilica of St Matthias in Berlin-Schönberg, where he served for 10 years; here, he was particularly remembered for his special concern for the poor and outcasts. In 1929, Fr von Galen was called back to Münster when Bishop Johannes Poggenpohlaskedhimtoserveas parish priest of the Church of St Lambert.\"Nec laudibus, nec timore' In January 1933, Bishop Poggenpohl died, leaving the See vacant. After two candidates refused, on September 5, 1933 Fr Clemens was appointed Bishop of Münster by Pope Pius XI. On October 28, 1933 he was consecrated by Cardinal Joseph Schulte, Archbishop of Cologne; Bishop von Galen was the first diocesan Bishop to be consecrated under Hitler's regime. As his motto, he chose the formula of the rite of episcopal consecration: \"Nec laudibus, nec timore\" (Neither praise nor threats will distance me from God). Throughout the 20 years that Bishop von Galen was curate and parish priest in Berlin, he wrote on various political and social issues; in a pastoral letter dated 26 March 1934, he wrote very clearly and critically on the \"neopaganism of the national socialist ideology\". Due to his outspoken criticism, he was called to Rome by Pope Pius XI in 1937 together with the Bishop of Berlin, to confer with them on the situation in Germany and speak of the eventual publication of an Encyclical. On 14 March 1937 the Encyclical \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (To the Bishops of Germany: The place of the Catholic Church in the German Reich) was published. It was widely circulated by Bishop von Galen, notwithstanding Nazi opposition.\"Lion of Munster' In the summer of 1941, in answer to unwarranted attacks by the National Socialists, Bishop von Galen delivered three admonitory sermons between July and August. He spoke in his old parish Church of St Lambert and in Liebfrauen-Ueberlassen Church, since the diocesan cathedral had been bombed. In his famous speeches, Bishop von Galen spoke out against the State confiscation of Church property and the programmatic euthanasia carried out by the regime. The clarity and incisiveness of his words and the unshakable fidelity of Catholics in the Diocese of Münster embarrassed the Nazi regime, and on 10 October 1943 the Bishop's residence was bombed. Bishop von Galen was forced to take refuge in nearby Borromeo College. From 12 September 1944 on, he could no longer remain in the city of Münster, destroyed by the war; he left for the zone of Sendenhorst. In 1945, Vatican Radio announced that Pope Pius XII was to hold a Consistory and that the Bishop of Münster was also to be present.Creation of a Cardinal After a long and difficult journey, due to the war and other impediments, Bishop von Galen finally arrived in the \"Eternal City\". On 21 February 1946 the Public Consistory was held in St Peter's Basilica and Bishop von Galen was created a Cardinal. On 16 March 1946 the 68-year-old Cardinal returned to Münster. He was cordially welcomed back by the city Authorities and awarded honorary citizenship by the burgomaster. On the site of what remained of the cathedral, Cardinal von Galen gave his first (and what would be his last) discourse to the more than 50,000 people who had gathered, thanking them for their fidelity to the then-Bishop of Münster during the National Socialist regime. He explained that as a Bishop, it was his duty to speak clearly and plainly about what was happening. No one knew that the Cardinal was gravely ill, and when he returned to Münster on 19 March 1946 he had to undergo an operation. Cardinal von Galen died just three days later, on 22 March. He was buried on 28 March in the Ludgerus Chapel, which has become a place of pilgrimage to this defender of the faith in the face of political oppression.</p><hr /><h3>St. Nicholas Owen()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>St. Lea()</h3><hr />"

Brought up in a pious family with regular devotions, Turibius' youth was a model of Christian virtue. His leisure took the forms of spiritual reading and devotions; and he dedicated himself to works of charity. He always gave his body a little less gratification than it demanded, and would make long pilgrimages on foot. Turibius' reputation as a master of canon and civil law reached the ears of King Philip II, who made him a judge at Granada. About that time, the see of Lima, Peru, fell vacant, and among those proposed, Philip II found no one who seemed better endowed than Turibius. The Roman Pontiff confirmed King Philip's appointment, and directed Turibius to receive Holy Orders and be consecrated. Yielding at last by direction of his confessor, Turibius was ordained priest and consecrated. He arrived at Lima in 1587. With humility and consistent effort, he edified the Christians and brought order to his episcopal city. A model of virtue, he received confessions daily and prepared for Mass by long meditation. Turibius then began visiting his vast diocese, which he traversed three times. His first visitation lasted seven years, and his second four. He held provincial councils and framed decrees and regulations adopted in neighboring countries. A leader in social equity as a principle for common good, Turibius channeled nearly his entire revenue toward establishing safety nets and uplifting the lives of the poor and marginalized. While zealously performing his duties during a third visitation, he was seized with a fatal illness. He passed away on March 23, 1606 at Santa, exclaiming, as he received the sacred Viaticum: \"I rejoiced in the things that were said to me: 'We shall go into the house of the Lord.'\"The proofs of his holy life and of the favors granted through his intercession led Pope Innocent XI to beatify him. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726.</p><hr /><h3>Sts Victorian and others(Martyrs (+ 484))</h3><hr /><p>STS. VICTORIAN AND OTHERS Martyrs (+ 484) Huneric, the Arian king of the Vandals in Africa, succeeded his father Genseric in 477. He behaved himself at first with moderation towards the Catholics, but in 480 he began a grievous persecution of the clergy and holy virgins, which in 484 became general, and vast numbers of Catholics were put to death. Victorian, one of the principal lords of the kingdom, had been made governor of Carthage, with the Roman title of Proconsul. He was the wealthiest subject of the king, who placed great confidence in him, and he had ever behaved with an inviolable fidelity. The king, after he had published his cruel edicts, sent a message to the proconsul, promising, if he would conform to his religion, to heap on him the greatest wealth and the highest honors which it was in the power of a prince to bestow. The proconsul, who amidst the glittering pomps of the world perfectly understood its emptiness, made this generous answer: \"Tell the king that I trust in Christ. His Majesty may condemn me to any torments, but I shall never consent to renounce the Catholic Church, in which I have been baptized. Even if there were no life after this, I would never be ungrateful and perfidious to God, Who has granted me the happiness of knowing Him, and bestowed on me His most precious graces.\" The tyrant became furious at this answer, nor can the tortures be imagined which he caused the Saint to endure. Victorian suffered them with joy, and amidst them finished his glorious martyrdom. The Roman Martyrology joins with him on this day four others who were crowned in the same persecution. Two brothers, who were apprehended for the faith, had promised each other, if possible, to die together; and they begged of God, as a favor, that they might both suffer the same torments. The persecutors hung them in the air with great weights at their feet. One of them, under the excess of pain, begged to be taken down for a little ease. His brother, fearing that this might move him to deny his faith, cried out from the rack, \"God forbid, dear brother, that you should ask such a thing. Is this what we promised to Jesus Christ?\" The other was so wonderfully encouraged that he cried out, \"No, no; I ask not to be released; increase my tortures, exert all your cruelties till they are exhausted upon me.\" They were then burned with red-hot plates of iron, and tormented so long that the executioners at last left them, saying, \"Everybody follows their example! no one now embraces our religion.\" This they said chiefly because, notwithstanding these brothers had been so long and so grievously tormented, there were no scars or bruises to be seen upon them. Two merchants of Carthage, who both bore the name of Frumentius, suffered martyrdom about the sane time. Among many glorious confessors at that time, one Liberatus, an eminent physician, was sent into banishment with his wife. He only grieved to see his infant children torn from him. His wife checked his tears by these words: \"Think no more of them: Jesus Christ Himself will have care of them and protect their souls.\" Whilst in prison she was told that her husband had conformed. Accordingly, when she met him at the bar before judge, she upbraided him in open court for having basely abandoned God; but discovered by his answer that a cheat had been put upon her to deceive her into her ruin. Twelve young children, when dragged away by the persecutors, held their companions by the knees till they were torn away by violence. They were most cruelly beaten and scourged every day for a long time; yet by God's grace every one of them persevered in the faith to the end of the persecution.</p>"

They walked in the hardness of their evil hearts and turned their backs, not their faces, to me.<br />From the day that your fathers left the land of Egypt even to this day, I have sent you untiringly all my servants the prophets.<br />Yet they have not obeyed me nor paid heed; they have stiffened their necks and done worse than their fathers.<br />When you speak all these words to them, they will not listen to you either; when you call to them, they will not answer you.<br />Say to them: This is the nation which does not listen to the voice of the LORD, its God, or take correction. Faithfulness has disappeared; the word itself is banished from their speech.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>95(94),1-2.6-7.8-9.</em><p>Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD; <br />let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.<br />Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; <br />let us joyfully sing psalms to him.<br />Come, let us bow down in worship; <br />let us kneel before the LORD who made us.<br />For he is our God, <br />and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides.<br />Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br />“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah, <br />as in the day of Massah in the desert,<br />Where your fathers tempted me; <br />they tested me though they had seen my works.”  </p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>11,14-23.</em><p>Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute, and when the demon had gone out, the mute man spoke and the crowds were amazed.<br />Some of them said, \"By the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, he drives out demons.\"<br />Others, to test him, asked him for a sign from heaven.<br />But he knew their thoughts and said to them, \"Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste and house will fall against house.<br />And if Satan is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?

At the age of seven, she was sent to the abbess of the convent of Riseberg to be educated. She soon showed, like her mother, a desire for a life of self-mortification and devotion to spiritual things. At the command of her father, when about thirteen or fourteen years, she married a noble of German descent, Eggart von Kürnen. She at once persuaded her husband, who was a very religious man, to join her in a vow of chastity. Both lived in a state of virginity and devoted themselves to the exercise of Christian perfection and active charity. In spite of her deep love for Eggart, Catherine accompanied her mother to Rome, where St. Bridget went in 1349. Soon after her arrival, Catherine received news of the death of her husband in Sweden. She now lived constantly with her mother, took an active part in St. Bridget's fruitful labours, and zealously imitated her mother's ascetic life. Although the distinguished and beautiful young widow was surrounded by suitors, she steadily refused all offers of marriage. In 1372, St. Catherine and her brother, Birger, accompanied their mother on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. After their return to Rome St. Catherine was with her mother in the latter's last illness and death. In 1374, in obedience to St. Bridget's wish, Catherine brought back her mother's body to Sweden for burial at Wadstena, of which foundation she now became the head. It was the motherhouse of the Brigittine Order, also called the Order of St. Saviour. Catherine managed the convent with great skill and made the life there one in harmony with the principles laid down by its founder. She passed away on March 24, 1381; and now reigns with Jesus in heaven.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Maria Karlowska (1865-1935)()</h3><hr /><p>Blessed Maria Karlowska Religious(1865-1935) Maria Karlowska was born in the territories under Prussian occupation in 1865. She worked as a true Samaritan among women suffering great material and moral deprivation. Her holy zeal quickly attracted a group of Christian disciples, with whom she founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd of Divine Providence. For herself and her Sisters she set the following goal: \"We must proclaim the Heart of Jesus, that is, so to live from him, in him and for him, as to become like him and that in our lives he may be more visible than we ourselves.\" Her devotion to the Saviour's Sacred Heart bore fruit in a great love for people. She felt an insatiable hunger for love. A love of this kind, according to Blessed Maria Karlowska, will never say \"enough,\" will never stop midway. Precisely this happened to her, who was, as it were transported by the current of love of the Divine Paraclete. Thanks to this love, she restored to many souls the light of Christ and helped them regain lost dignity.</p><hr /><h3>Saint Oscar Romero (1917 - 1980)()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Oscar Romero (1917 - , CardinalEarly lifeOscar Romero was born into a large family on August 15, 1917 in El Salvador. Althoughthey had more money than many of their neighbours, Oscar’s family had neitherelectricity nor running water in their small home, and the children slept on the floor.Oscar’s parents could not afford to send him to school after the age of twelve, so he wentto work as an apprentice carpenter. He quickly showed great skills, but Oscar wasalready determined to become a priest. He entered the seminary at the age of fourteenand was ordained a priest when he was 25 in 1942. Recognising the power of radio to reach the people, he convinced five radio stations to broadcast his Sunday sermons to peasant farmers who believed they were unwelcome in the churches.In 1970, he became Auxiliary Bishop in San Salvador. In 1974 he became Bishop of Santiago de Maria. At this time,Oscar Romero was described as a conservative, not wanting to break from tradition. He supported the hierarchy whoencouraged conformity. He was uncomfortable with social action that challenged political leaders.Growing awarenessDuring his two years as Bishop of Santiago de Maria, Romero was horrified to find that children were dying becausetheir parents could not pay for simple medicines. He began using the resources of the diocese and his own personalresources to help the poor, but he knew that simple charity was not enough. He wrote in his diary that people who arepoor should not just receive handouts from the Church or the government but participate in changing their lives for thefuture.In 1977, Romero became Archbishop of San Salvador, the capital city. The situation in El Salvador was becoming worseand he couldn’t remain silent any longer. The military were killing the Salvadorian people - especially those demandingjustice such as teachers, nuns and priests – including Romero’s good friend, Fr Rutilio Grande.Thousands of people began to go missing. Romero demanded that the President of El Salvador thoroughlyinvestigate the killings, but he failed to do so.Voice of the voicelessIn his actions and words, Oscar demanded a peace that could only be found by ensuring people had access to basicneeds and their rights upheld. He raised awareness globally about the people in his country who had been killed or\"disappeared\". When he visited the Vatican in 1979, Oscar Romero presented the Pope with seven detailed reports ofmurder, torture, and kidnapping throughout El Salvador.In 1979, the number of people being killed rose to more than 3000 per month. Oscar Romero had nothing left to offer hispeople except faith and hope. He continued to use the radio broadcast of his Sunday sermons to tell people what washappening throughout the country, to talk about the role of the Church and to offer his listeners hope that they would notsuffer and die in vain.MartyrdomOn March 23, 1980, after reporting the previous week’s deaths and disappearances, Oscar Romero began to speakdirectly to soldiers and policemen: “I beg you, I implore you, I order you... in the name of God, stop the repression!” Thefollowing evening, while saying Mass in the chapel of Divine Providence Hospital, Archbishop Oscar Romero was shotby a paid assassin.Only moments before his death, Romero spoke these prophetic words: “Those who surrender to the service of the poorthrough love of Christ will live like the grain of wheat that dies… The harvest comes because of the grain that dies.” Likemany great leaders who have fought for truth, Oscar Romero was killed and became a martyr, but his voice could not besilenced. He is a symbol of hope in a country that has suffered poverty, injustice and violence.</p>"

His father, a nobleman, committed Ludger to the care of St. Gregory, St. Boniface's disciple. Ludger was educated in the see of Utrecht, in St. Gregory's monastery, and received the clerical tonsure. Desiring further sanctity and transcendence, responsive to the will and callings of the Master, Ludger went to England and spent four and a half years training with Alcuin, the rector of a famous school at York. In 773, Ludger returned to Friesland. When St. Gregory passed away in 776, Alberic, the successor, compelled Ludger to receive Holy Orders. After ordination, Fr. Ludger preached the Gospel in Friesland, where he converted great numbers, founded several monasteries, and built several churches. When the pagan Saxons ravaged the country, Fr. Ludger travelled to Rome to consult Pope Adrian II, and what he thought God required. He then retired for three and a half years to Monte Casino, where he wore the habit of the Order and conformed to the practice of the rule. In 787, Charlemagne overcame the Saxons and conquered Friesland and the coast of the Germanic Ocean as far as Denmark. Fr. Ludger, hearing this, returned into East Friesland, where he converted the Saxons to the Faith, as he also did the province of Westphalia. Fr. Ludger founded the monastery of Werden, twenty-nine miles from Cologne. In 802, Hildebald, Archbishop of Cologne, consecrated Fr. Ludger Bishop of Munster. Bp. Ludger then appointed five cantons from Friesland he had converted, and founded the Monastery of Helmstad in the duchy of Brunswick. Being accused of wasting his income and neglecting the adornment of churches, Bp. Ludger was ordered to appear at court. The morning after his arrival, Emperor Charlemagne's chamberlain brought him word that his attendance was required. The Saint, being at his prayers, told the officer that he would follow him as soon as he finished. By the time hewas ready, the courtiers represented Bp. Ludger's devotion as contempt of his Majesty. When the audience finally transpired, Emperor Charlemagne,with some emotion, asked Bp. Ludger why he made him wait so long. The bishop answered that he had profound respect for his Majesty, but God was infinitely above him; that while we are occupied with Him, it is our duty to forget everything else. This answer made such an impression that the Emperor he dismissed Bp. Ludger and disgraced his accusers. St. Ludger was favored with the gifts of miracles and prophecy. His last sickness, though excruciating, did not hinder him from continuing his functions to the last day of his life: Passion Sunday. That day, Bp. Ludger preached very early in the morning, said Mass towards nine, and preached again before night. He passed away on March 26, midnight, at the hour he had foretold, and was interred at Werden Abbey.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Maddalena Caterina Morano (1847-1908)()</h3><hr /><p>BLESSED MADDALENA CATERINA MORANO (1847-1908) Blessed Maddalena Caterina Morano was born in 1847 to a large family in Chieri, near Turin, Italy. When she was eight, her father and older sister passed away, and so young Maddalena had to work. However, she applied herself to study as well, and in 1866 she received her diploma as an elementary school teacher. Her studies increased her knowledge of Christian doctrine and her longing to be a saint. She wished to enter religious life, but the needs of her family required her to wait. For 12 years she worked as a rural school teacher in Montaldo and taught catechism in the local parish. In 1878, having set aside enough savings for her mother's future needs, Maddalena entered the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, a congregation founded six years earlier by Don Bosco. She was a model religious, and after a brief but intense novitiate, she took her first vows. In 1881, with Don Bosco's blessing, she was sent to Trecastagni (Diocese of Catania), Sicily, and put in charge of an existing institute for women, to which she gave a new orientation inspired by the principles of the Salesian method. Sicily became her second home, where she carried out a varied and fruitful apostolate. She opened new houses, set up after-school activities and sewing classes, trained teachers, and conducted apostolic activities. Her real love, though, was for catechism class, since she was convinced that the formation of Christian conscience was the basis of personal maturity and all social improvement. She coordinated catechetical instruction in eighteen of Catania's churches and trained lay and religious catechists to bring the Christian message to needy boys and girls. She spent twenty-five years in Sicily and served her community as local and provincial superior. She was an attentive mother and cared for many local vocations, faithfully living the charism of Mother Maria Mazzarello, co-foundress of the institute. She passed away in Catania at the age of 61 on 26 March 1908. She was beatified on November 5, 1994 at Catania by St. Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Margaret Clitherow()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.<br />For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>15,1-3.11-32.</em><p>Tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to listen to Jesus,<br />but the Pharisees and scribes began to complain, saying, \"This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.\"<br />So to them he addressed this parable.<br />Then he said, \"A man had two sons,<br />and the younger son said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of your estate that should come to me.' So the father divided the property between them.<br />After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.<br />When he had freely spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need.<br />So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.<br />And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any.<br />Coming to his senses he thought, 'How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food to eat, but here am I, dying from hunger.<br />I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<br />I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.\"'<br />So he got up and went back to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.<br />His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.'<br />But his father ordered his servants, 'Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<br />Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with a feast,<br />because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found.' Then the celebration began.<br />Now the older son had been out in the field and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard the sound of music and dancing.<br />He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.<br />The servant said to him, 'Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'<br />He became angry, and when he refused to enter the house, his father came out and pleaded with him.<br />He said to his father in reply, 'Look, all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.<br />But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.'<br />He said to him, 'My son, you are here with me always; everything I have is yours.<br />But now we must celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. John of Egypt (+ 394)()</h3><p>SAINT JOHN OF EGYPT (+ 394) Till he was twenty-five, John worked with his father as a carpenter. Then feeling a call from God, he left the world and committed himself to a holy solitary in the desert. His master tried his spirit by many unreasonable commands, bidding him roll the hard rocks, tend dead trees, and the like. John obeyed in all things with the simplicity of a child. After a careful training of sixteen years he withdrew to the top of a steep cliff to think only of God and his soul. The more he knew of himself, the more he distrusted himself. For the last fifty years, therefore, he never saw women, and seldom men. The result of this vigilance and purity was threefold: a holy joy and cheerfulness which consoled all who conversed with him; perfect obedience to superiors; and, in return for this, authority over creatures, whom he had forsaken for the Creator. St. Augustine tells us of his appearing in a vision to a holy woman, whose sight he had restored, to avoid seeing her face to face. Devils assailed him continually, but John never ceased his prayer. From his long communings with God, he turned to men with gifts of healing and prophecy. Twice each week he spoke through a window with those who came to him, blessing oil for their sick and predicting things to come. A deacon came to him in disguise, and he reverently kissed his hand. To the Emperor Theodosius he foretold his future victories and the time of his death. The three last days of his life John gave wholly to God: on the third he was found on his knees as if in prayer, but his soul was with the blessed. He passed away in 394.</p><hr /><h3>St. Rupert of Salzburg()</h3><hr />"

No longer shall the sound of weeping be heard there, or the sound of crying;<br />No longer shall there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not round out his full lifetime; He dies a mere youth who reaches but a hundred years, and he who fails of a hundred shall be thought accursed.<br />They shall live in the houses they build, and eat the fruit of the vineyards they plant.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>30(29),2.4.5-6.11-12a.13b.</em><p>I will extol you, O LORD, for you drew me clear <br />and did not let my enemies rejoice over me.<br />O LORD, you brought me up from the nether world; <br />you preserved me from among those going down into the pit.<br />Sing praise to the LORD, you his faithful ones, <br />and give thanks to his holy name.<br />For his anger lasts but a moment; <br />a lifetime, his good will.<br />At nightfall, weeping enters in, <br />but with the dawn, rejoicing.<br />Hear, O LORD, and have pity on me; <br />O LORD, be my helper.”<br />You changed my mourning into dancing;<br />O LORD, my God, forever will I give you thanks.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>4,43-54.</em><p>At that time Jesus left [Samaria] for Galilee.<br />For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his native place.<br />When he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all he had done in Jerusalem at the feast; for they themselves had gone to the feast.<br />Then he returned to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. Now there was a royal official whose son was ill in Capernaum.<br />When he heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, who was near death.<br />Jesus said to him, \"Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will not believe.\"<br />The royal official said to him, \"Sir, come down before my child dies.\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"You may go; your son will live.\" The man believed what Jesus said to him and left.<br />While he was on his way back, his slaves met him and told him that his boy would live.<br />He asked them when he began to recover. They told him, \"The fever left him yesterday, about one in the afternoon.\"<br />The father realized that just at that time Jesus had said to him, \"Your son will live,\" and he and his whole household came to believe.<br />(Now) this was the second sign Jesus did when he came to Galilee from Judea.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gontran(King (545-592))</h3><p>SAINT GONTRAN King (545-592) St. Gontran was the son of King Clotaire and grandson of Clovis I and St. Clotildis. Being the second son, Gontran was crowned king of Orleans and Burgundy in 561, making Chalons his capital. His brothers, Charibert and Sigebert, reigned at Paris and Ostrasia. When compelled to take up arms against his ambitious brothers and the Lombards, King Gontran was victorious with the help of a brave general, Mommol. Together, they brought peace to the realm. The ensuing prosperity affirmed that civil law, derived from moral law, finds its basis and fulfillment in the Gospel. King Gontran treated the pastors of the Church with respect and veneration. He protected the oppressed with the worth and justice of a king. He prayed, fasted, and offered himself to God day and night. King Gontran punished crimes committed by his officers and implemented regulations to restrain the sometimes barbarous conduct of his troops. In the face of adversity and moral pain, he was more ready to forgive offences against his own person than anyone. King Gontran built and endowed many churches and monasteries. He passed away in 592, in the sixty-eighth year of his age, having reigned thirty-one years and some months.</p>"

Again he measured off a thousand and had me wade; the water was up to my waist.<br />Once more he measured off a thousand, but there was now a river through which I could not wade; for the water had risen so high it had become a river that could not be crossed except by swimming.<br />He asked me, \"Have you seen this, son of man?\" Then he brought me to the bank of the river, where he had me sit.<br />Along the bank of the river I saw very many trees on both sides.<br />He said to me, \"This water flows into the eastern district down upon the Arabah, and empties into the sea, the salt waters, which it makes fresh.<br />Wherever the river flows, every sort of living creature that can multiply shall live, and there shall be abundant fish, for wherever this water comes the sea shall be made fresh.<br />Along both banks of the river, fruit trees of every kind shall grow; their leaves shall not fade, nor their fruit fail. Every month they shall bear fresh fruit, for they shall be watered by the flow from the sanctuary. Their fruit shall serve for food, and their leaves for medicine.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>46(45),2-3.5-6.8-9.</em><p>God is our refuge and our strength, <br />an ever-present help in distress.<br />Therefore, we fear not, though the earth be shaken <br />and mountains plunge into the depths of the sea.<br />There is a stream whose runlets gladden the city of God, <br />the holy dwelling of the Most High.<br />God is in its midst; it shall not be disturbed; <br />God will help it at the break of dawn.<br />The LORD of hosts is with us; <br />our stronghold is the God of Jacob.<br />Come! behold the deeds of the LORD, <br />the astounding things he has wrought on earth.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>5,1-16.</em><p>There was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br />Now there is in Jerusalem at the Sheep (Gate) a pool called in Hebrew Bethesda, with five porticoes.<br />In these lay a large number of ill, blind, lame, and crippled.<br />One man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.<br />When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been ill for a long time, he said to him, \"Do you want to be well?\"<br />The sick man answered him, \"Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; while I am on my way, someone else gets down there before me.\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"Rise, take up your mat, and walk.\"<br />Immediately the man became well, took up his mat, and walked. Now that day was a sabbath.<br />So the Jews said to the man who was cured, \"It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.\"<br />He answered them, \"The man who made me well told me, 'Take up your mat and walk.'\"<br />They asked him, \"Who is the man who told you, 'Take it up and walk'?\"<br />The man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away, since there was a crowd there.<br />After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him, \"Look, you are well; do not sin any more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.\"<br />The man went and told the Jews that Jesus was the one who had made him well.<br />Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he did this on a sabbath.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gladys(Hermit (5th century))</h3><p>Saint Gladys Hermit (5th century) Gladys was born in Wales in the 5th century. She was one of the 24 children of Brychan of Brecknock, wife of Saint Gundleus, and mother of Saints Cadoc and, possibly, Keyna. It is said that after their conversion by the example and exhortation of their son, she and Gundleus lived an austere life. When Gundleus died, Gladys moved to Pencanau in Bassaleg and lived as a hermit.</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Jonas(Barachisius and Co, Martyrs (4th century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINTS JONAS, BARACHISIUS and their Companions Martyrs (4th century) King Sapor, of Persia (modern Iran), in the eighteenth year of his reign, raised a bloody persecution against the Christians, and laid waste their churches and monasteries. Jonas and Barachisius, two brothers of the city Beth-Asa, hearing that several Christians lay under sentence of death at Hubaham, went thither to encourage and serve them. Nine of that number received the crown of martyrdom. After their execution, Jonas and Barachisius were apprehended for having exhorted them to die. The president entreated the two brothers to obey the king of Persia, and to worship the sun, moon, fire, and water. Their answer was, that it was more reasonable to obey the immortal King of heaven and earth than a mortal prince. Jonas was beaten with knotty clubs and with rods, and next set in a frozen pond, with a cord tied to his foot. Barachisius had two red-hot iron plates and two red-hot hammers applied under each arm, and melted lead dropped into his nostrils and eyes; after which he was carried to prison, and there hung up by one foot. Despite these cruel tortures, the two brothers remained steadfast in the Faith. New and more horrible torments were then devised under which at last they yielded up their lives, while their pure souls winged their flight to heaven, there to gain the martyr's crown, which they had so faithfully won.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mark of Arethusa(Bishop (+ c. 365))</h3><hr /><p></p>"

When he turned sixteen, he left the world and its shining prospects to retire in Mt. Sinai. There, he put himself under the direction of a holy monk. St. John was a fervent novice and unrelaxing in his efforts for self-mastery. After four years, he took vows, and an aged abbot foretold that he would some day be one of the greatest lights of the Church. Nineteen years later, on the death of his director, St. John withdrew into a deeper solitude, where he studied the lives and writings of the Saints, and was raised to an unusual height of contemplation. The fame of his holiness and practical wisdom drew crowds seeking advice and consolation. For his greater sanctity, he visited the solitudes of Egypt. At the age of seventy-five, he was chosen abbot of Mt. Sinai, and there \"he dwelt in the mount of God, and drew from the rich treasure of his heart priceless riches of doctrine, which he poured forth with wondrous abundance and benediction.\" He was induced by a brother abbot to write the rules by which he had guided his life; and his book called the Climax, or Ladder of Perfection, has been prized in all ages for its wisdom, its clearness, and its unction.</p>"

Then I will make of you a great nation.\"<br />But Moses implored the LORD, his God, saying, \"Why, O LORD, should your wrath blaze up against your own people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with such great power and with so strong a hand?<br />Why should the Egyptians say, 'With evil intent he brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the face of the earth'? Let your blazing wrath die down; relent in punishing your people.<br />Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and how you swore to them by your own self, saying, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky; and all this land that I promised, I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.'\"<br />So the LORD relented in the punishment he had threatened to inflict on his people.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>106(105),19-20.21-22.23.</em><p>Our fathers made a calf in Horeb <br />and adored a molten image;<br />They exchanged their glory <br />for the image of a grass-eating bullock.<br />They forgot the God who had saved them, <br />who had done great deeds in Egypt,<br />Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, <br />terrible things at the Red Sea.<br />Then he spoke of exterminating them, <br />but Moses, his chosen one, <br />withstood him in the breach <br />to turn back his destructive wrath.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>5,31-47.</em><p>Jesus said to the Jews: \"If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is not true.<br />But there is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is true.<br />You sent emissaries to John, and he testified to the truth.<br />I do not accept testimony from a human being, but I say this so that you may be saved.<br />He was a burning and shining lamp, and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light.<br />But I have testimony greater than John's.

King Isdegerdes thereupon demolished all the Christian churches in Persia, put to death Abdas, and raised a general persecution against the Church, which continued forty years with great fury. Isdegerdes died the year following, in 421. But his son and successor, Varanes, carried on the persecution with greater inhumanity. The very recital of the cruelties he exercised on the Christian strikes us with horror. Among the glorious champions of Christ was St. Benjamin, a deacon. The tyrant caused him to be beaten and imprisoned. He had lain a year in the dungeon, when an ambassador from the emperor obtained his release on condition that he should never speak to any of the courtiers about religion. The ambassador passed his word in his behalf that he would not; but Benjamin, who was a minister of the Gospel, declared that he should miss no opportunity of announcing Christ. The king, being informed that he still preached the Faith in his kingdom, ordered him to be apprehended. He suffered tortures frequently repeated with violence. Lastly, he expired about the year 424.</p>"
