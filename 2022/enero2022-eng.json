He followed a monastic way of life for some years. He and Saint Basil were best friends forever. St. Gregory was appointed Bishop of Constantinople in 379, when the Arian controversy reached fever pitch. He was forced to retire to Nazianzus, where he passed away on January 25, 390. St. Gregory's learning and oratory power were Graces, and he was called The Theologian.

The patriarch, warned by a miracle of his disciple's sanctity, named him the heir of his virtues. When St. Macarius precticed mortification of the senses: Praying and devotion though exhausted and sleepy; accepting with manly joy uncomfortable circumstances. When he was thirsty, he received a present of grapes, but gave them to a hermit toiling in the heat. Macarius saw demons assailing some hermits at prayer. Excorcists and Faithful say they sometimes manifest as dark, rotten orbs, taking one's vision. The demons put their fingers into the mouths of hermits and made them yawn. They closed the eyes of others, and walked upon them when asleep. They placed vain and sensual images before many of the brethren, and then mocked those who were captivated. None vanquished the devils effectually save the Blessed Virgin Mary; who's wisdom and faith trancends vigilance. After serving as Superior for years, Macarius fled to St. Pachomius to begin again as a novice; but St. Pachomius, instructed by a vision, bade him return to his brethren, who embraced him as their father. Although suffering persecution from Arian heretics, St. Pachomius \"fought the good fight,\" and passed away, like St. Joseph, in the peace of the Holy Family.</p>"

St. Germanus, when passing through, predicted her future sanctity. At seven years of age, she made a vow of perpetual chastity. After the death of her parents, Paris became her abode; but she often travelled on works of mercy, which, by the gifts of prophecy and miracles, she unfailingly performed. At one time, she was cruelly persecuted: Her enemies, jealous of her power, called her a hypocrite and tried to drown her; but St. Germanus having sent her the Eucharist as a token of esteem, the outcry ceased, and ever afterwards she was honored. During the siege of Paris by Childeric, king of the Franks, St. Genevieve went out with a few followers and procured corn for the starving citizens. Childeric, though a warlord and pagan, honored her; and at her request, spared the lives of many prisoners. By her exhortations again, when Attila and his Huns were approaching the city, the inhabitants, instead of taking flight, gave themselves to prayer and penance, and averted, as she had foretold, the impending scourge. Clovis, when converted from paganism by his holy wife, St. Clotilda, made St. Genevieve his constant adviser, and, in spite of his violent character, made a generous and Christian king. St. Genevieve passed away within a few weeks of that monarch, in 512, aged eighty-nine. In 1129, a pestilence broke out in Paris, killing fourteen thousand people. At length, on November 26th, the shrine of St. Genevieve was carried in solemn procession through the city. Only three persons died that day, the rest recovered, and no others were taken ill. This was but the first of a series of miraculous favors which the city of Paris has obtained through the relics of its patron Saint.</p>"

Elizabeth Ann Seton is a Saint! We rejoice and we are deeply moved that our apostolic ministry authorizes us to make this solemn declaration before all of you here present, before the holy Catholic Church, before our other Christian brethren in the world, before the entire American people, and before all humanity. Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton is a Saint! She is the first daughter of the United States of America to be glorified with this incomparable attribute! But what do we mean when we say: «She is a Saint»? We all have some idea of the meaning of this highest title; but it is still difficult for us to make an exact analysis of it. Being a Saint means being perfect, with a perfection that attains the highest level that a human being can reach. A Saint is a human creature fully conformed to the will of God. A Saint is a person in whom all sin-the principle of death-is cancelled out and replaced by the living splendor of divine grace. The analysis of the concept of sanctity brings us to recognize in a soul the mingling of two elements that are entirely different but which come together to produce a single effect: sanctity. One of these elements is the human and moral element, raised to the degree of heroism: heroic virtues are always required by the Church for the recognition of a person's sanctity. The second element is the mystical element, which express the measure and form of divine action in the person chosen by God to realize in herself-always in an original way-the image of Christ (Cfr. Rom. 8, 29). The science of sanctity is therefore the most interesting, the most varied, the most surprising and the most fascinating of all the studies of that ever mysterious being which is man. The Church has made this study of the life, that is, the interior and exterior history, of Elizabeth Ann Seton. And the Church has exulted with admiration and joy, and has today heard her own charism of truth poured out in the exclamation that we send up to God and announce to the world: She is a Saint! (...). This will be one of the most valuable fruits of the Canonization of the new Saint: to know her, in order to admire in her an outstanding human figure; in order to praise God who is wonderful in his saints; to imitate her example which this ceremony places in a light that will give perennial edification; to invoke her protection, now that we have the certitude of her participation in the exchange of heavenly life in the Mystical Body of Christ, which we call the Communion of Saints and in which we also share, although still belonging to life on earth. (...) Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton was born, brought up and educated in New York in the Episcopalian Communion. To this Church goes the merit of having awakened and fostered the religious sense and Christian sentiment which in the young Elizabeth were naturally predisposed to the most spontaneous and lively manifestations. We willingly recognize this merit, and, knowing well how much it cost Elizabeth to pass over to the Catholic Church, we admire her courage for adhering to the religious truth and divine reality which were manifested to her therein. And we are likewise pleased to see that from this same adherence to the Catholic Church she experienced great peace and security, and found it natural to preserve all the good things which her membership in the fervent Episcopalian community had taught her, in so many beautiful expressions, especially of religious piety, and that she was always faithful in her esteem and affection for those from whom her Catholic profession had sadly separated her. (...) And then we must note that Elizabeth Seton was the mother of a family and at the same time the foundress of the first Religious Congregation of women in the United States. (...)The Church renders the greatest honor possible to Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton and extols her personal and extraordinary contribution as a woman a wife, a mother, a widow, and a religious. May the dynamism and authenticity of her life be an example in our day-and for generations to come-of what women can and must accomplish, in the fulfillment of their role, for the good of humanity. And finally we must recall that the most notable characteristic of our Saint is the fact that she was, as we said, the foundress of the first Religious Congregation of women in the United States. It was an offspring of the religious family of Saint Vincent de Paul, which later divided into various autonomous branches-five principal ones-now spread throughout the world. And yet all of them recognize their origin in the first group, that of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph's, personally established by Saint Elizabeth Seton at Emmitsburg in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. The apostolate of helping the poor and the running of parochial schools in America had this humble, poor, courageous and glorious beginning. (...) Yes, brethren, and sons and daughters: the Lord is indeed wonderful in his saints. Blessed be God for ever![ Canonization of Elisabeth Ann Seton: Homily of Pope Paul VI - September 14, 1975]</p><hr /><h3>St. Gregory(Bishop († c. 541))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GREGORYBishop( c. 541) St. Gregory was one of the principal senators of Autun and a widower after the death of his wife. At the age of fifty-seven, he was consecrated Bishop of Langres for his proven virtues. He governed the See with admirable prudence and zeal for thirty-three years, sanctifying his pastoral labors with humility, prayer, and mortification of the senses. An incredible number of idolaters or pagans were converted by him; and worldly or materialistic Christians rejected Satan by correcting their personal disorders. St. Gregory passed away after the feast of the Epiphany in 541. Out of devotion to St. Benignus, he was buried near that Saint's tomb at Dijon.</p>"

His great affection for the American missions brought him to the United States as a cleric, and he was ordained in New York in 1836. In 1840, he entered the Congragation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists). He labored in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. In 1852, he was consecrated bishop of Philadelphia. There, he worked hard for the establishment of parish schools and parishes for immigrants. St. John Neumann passed away on January 5, 1860. He was beatified in 1963 and canonized in 1977.</p><hr /><h3>St. Genoveva Torres Morales(Foundress (1870-1956))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Genoveva Torres MoralesFoundress of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Holy Angels (The Angélicas)(1870-1956) Genoveva Torres Morales was born on January 3, 1870 in Almenara, Castille, Spain, the youngest of six children. By the age of eight, both her parents and four of her siblings had died, leaving Genoveva to care for the home and her brother, José. Although he treated her with respect, José was very demanding and taciturn. Being deprived of affection and companionship from her early years, Genoveva became accustomed to solitude. When she was 10, she took a special interest in reading spiritual books. Through this pursuit, she came to understand that true happiness is doing God's will, and it was for this reason that each one of us is created. This became her rule of life. At the age of 13, Genoveva's left leg had to be amputated in order to stop the gangrene that was spreading there. The amputation was done in her home, and since the anaesthesia was not sufficient, the pain was excruciating. Throughout her life, her leg caused her pain and sickness, and she was forced to use crutches. From 1885 to 1894, she lived at the Mercy Home run by the Carmelites of Charity. In the nine years she lived with the sisters and with other children, the young Genoveva deepened her life of piety and perfected her sewing skills. It was also in these years that Fr Carlos Ferrís, a diocesan priest and future Jesuit and founder of a leprosarium in Fontilles, would guide the \"beginnings\" of her spiritual and apostolic life. God also gave Genoveva the gift of \"spiritual liberty,\" and this was something she would endeavour to practise throughout her life. Reflecting on this period at the Mercy Home, she later would write: \"I loved freedom of heart very much, and worked and am working to achieve it fully.... It does the soul so much good that every effort is nothing compared with this free condition of the heart\". Genoveva intended to join the Carmelites of Charity, but it seems she was not accepted due to her physical condition. She longed to be consecrated to God and, being of a decided and resolute nature, she continued to be open to his guidance. In 1894, Genoveva left the Carmelites of Charity's home and went to live briefly with two women who supported themselves by their own work. Together they \"shared\" the solitude and poverty. In 1911, Canon Barbarrós suggested that Genoveva begin a new religious community, pointing out that there were many poor women who could not afford to live on their own and thus suffered much hardship. For years, Genoveva had thought of starting a religious congregation that would be solely concerned with meeting the needs of such women, since she knew of no one engaged in this work. With the help of Canon Barbarrós and Fr Martín Sánchez, S.J., the first community was established in Valencia. Shortly thereafter, other women arrived, wanting to share the same apostolic and spiritual life. It was not long before more communities were established in other parts of Spain, despite many problems and obstacles. A constant source of suffering for Mother Genoveva was her involvement in external activity and the new foundations. She desired to return to her characteristic interior solitude and remain alone with the Lord, but she accepted her calling as God's will and did not let her physical or interior suffering stop her. She would say: \"Even if I must suffer greatly, thanks be to God's mercy, I will not lack courage\". She was known for her kindness and openness to all, and for her good sense of humour - she would even joke about her physical ailments. In 1953, the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Holy Angels received Pontifical approval. Mother Genoveva died on January 5, 1956. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II on January 29, 1995 and canonized on May 4, 2003 at Madrid.</p><hr /><h3>St. Simeon Stylites (c.401-460)()</h3><hr /><p>SAINT SIMEON STYLITES(c.401 - 460) One winter's day, about the year 401, the snow lay thick around Sisan, a little town in Cilicia. A shepherd boy, who could not lead his sheep to the fields on account of the cold, went to the church instead, and listened to the eight Beatitudes, which were read that morning. He asked how these blessings were to be obtained, and when he was told of the monastic life, a thirst for perfection arose within him. He became the wonder of the world, the great St. Simeon Stylites. He was warned that perfection would cost him dear, and so it did. A mere child, he began the monastic life, and therein passed a dozen years in superhuman austerity. On at least one occassion, he ate but once in seven days. When God led him to a solitary life, he kept fasts of forty days. For thirty-seven years, he climbed on the top of pillars, exposed to heat and cold, day and night adoring the majesty of God. Perfection was all in all to St. Simeon; the means nothing - except in so far as God chose them for him. The solitaries of Egypt were suspicious of a life so new and so strange, and they sent one of their number to bid St. Simeon come down from his pillar and return to the common life. In a moment the Saint made ready to descend; but the Egyptian religious was satisfied with this proof of humility. \"Stay,\" he said, \"and take courage; your way of life is from God.\" Cheerfulness, humility, and obedience set their seal upon the austerities of St. Simeon. The words which God put into his mouth brought crowds of pagans to baptism and of sinners to penance. At last, in the year 460, those who watched below noticed that he had been motionless three whole days. They ascended, and found the old man's body still bent in the attitude of prayer, but his soul was with God. Extraordinary as the life of St. Simeon may appear, it teaches us two plain and practical lessons: First, we must constantly renew within ourselves an intense desire for perfection. Secondly, we must use with fidelity and courage the means of perfection God points out. \"Take up your cross and follow me\" (Mt 16:24).</p>"

He unrolled the scroll and found the passage where it was written:<br />\"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, <br />because he has anointed me <br />to bring glad tidings to the poor. <br />He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives <br />and recovery of sight to the blind, <br />to let the oppressed go free,<br />and to proclaim a year acceptable to the Lord.\"<br />Rolling up the scroll, he handed it back to the attendant and sat down, and the eyes of all in the synagogue looked intently at him.<br />He said to them, \"Today this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.\"<br />And all spoke highly of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth.</p><hr /><h3>St. Andre Bessette(C.S.C. (1845-1937))</h3><p>Saint Brother André BessetteC.SC.(1845-1937) Brother André was born Alfred Bessette on August 9, 1845, in Quebec, Canada. By the age of twelve, André and his siblings were left orphans-their mother died of tuberculosis, and their father had died three years earlier in a lumbering accident. Though he was barely able to read or write, André was forced to leave school and learn a trade. For thirteen years he labored in various industries despite his own frail health. In 1870, he entered the Congregation of Holy Cross and was assigned as the doorkeeper of the community's high school in Montreal. There he welcomed the sick and suffering of the city and encouraged them to pray to Saint Joseph, to whom the Holy Cross Brothers were dedicated by their founder, The Venerable Basil Moreau, C.S.C. Brother André's visitors often found that they had been healed of their illnesses and received other spiritual favors. Brother André became known as the \"Miracle Man\" of Montreal, but he always gave the credit to Saint Joseph. So many people came to call on Brother André that he built a small chapel to Saint Joseph across the street from the school. Through André's determination and prayer, and the generosity of his many friends, the great Oratory of Saint Joseph began to rise on Mount Royal. Today millions of visitors still come to the Oratory to pray to Saint Joseph and to Blessed Brother André, and to seek physical and spiritual healing. Brother André died on January 6, 1937 at the age of 92. This simple man of prayer was so beloved, that more than a million people attended his funeral in a blinding snowstorm. His body lies in the beautiful basilica he built in honor of St. Joseph. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on May 23, 1982. In his homily that day, The Holy Father said this of Brother André:\"A daily crowd of the sick, the afflicted, the poor of all kinds-those who were handicapped or wounded by life-came to him. They found in his presence a welcome ear, comfort and faith in God. Do not the poor of today have as much need of such love, of such hope, of such education in prayer?\" He was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 17, 2010.</p>"

Be made clean.\" And the leprosy left him immediately.<br />Then he ordered him not to tell anyone, but \"Go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses prescribed; that will be proof for them.\"<br />The report about him spread all the more, and great crowds assembled to listen to him and to be cured of their ailments,<br />but he would withdraw to deserted places to pray.</p><hr /><h3>St. Raymond of Peñafort(Priest (c. 1175-1275))</h3><p>SAINT RAYMUND OF PEÑAFORTPriest(C. 1175-1275) Born A. D. 1175, of a noble Spanish family, Raymund, at the age of twenty, taught philosophy at Barcelona with marvellous success. Ten years later his rare abilities won for him the degree of Doctor in the University of Bologna, and many high dignities. A tender devotion to our blessed Lady, which had grown up with him from childhood, determined him in middle life to renounce all his honors and to enter her Order of St. Dominic. There, again, a vision of the Mother of Mercy instructed him to cooperate with his penitent St. Peter Nolasco, and with James, King of Aragon, in founding the Order of Our Lady of Ransom for the Redemption of Captives. He began this great work by preaching a crusade against the Moors, and rousing to penance the Christians, enslaved in both soul and body by Islamic armies. King James of Aragon, a man of great qualities, but held in bond by a ruling passion, was bidden by the Saint to put away the cause of his sin. On his delay, Raymund asked for leave to depart from Majorca, since he could not live with sin. The king refused, and forbade, under pain of death, his conveyance by others. Full of faith, Raymund spread his cloak upon the waters, and, tying one end to his staff as a sail, made the sign of the cross and fearlessly stepped upon it. In six hours he was borne to Barcelona, where, gathering up his cloak dry, he stole into his monastery. The king, overcome by this miracle, became a sincere penitent and the disciple of the Saint till his death. In 1230, Gregory IX. summoned Raymund to Rome, made him his confessor and grand penitentiary, and directed him to compile \"The Decretals,\" a collection of the scattered decisions of the Popes and Councils. Having refused the archbishopric of Tarragona, Raymund found himself in 1238 chosen third General of his Order; which post he again succeeded in resigning, on the score of his advanced age. His first act when set free was to resume his labors among the Saracens, and in 1256 Raymund, then eighty-one, was able to report that ten thousand Muslims had received Baptism. He died A. D. 1275.</p><hr /><h3>St. Angela Foligno (1248 - 1309)()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Angela of Foligno(1248 – 4 January 1309) St. Angela of Foligno was a Christian mystic who wrote extensively about her mystical revelations. She was a Franciscan tertiary and was known as \"Mistress of Theologians\". She was noted not only for her spiritual writings, but also for founding a religious community which refused to accept becoming an enclosed religious order that it might continue her vision of caring for those in need. Pope Francis declared her a saint on 9 October 2013, Some saints show marks of holiness very early. Not Angela! Born of a leading family in Foligno, Italy, she became immersed in the quest for wealth and social position. As a wife and mother, she continued a life of distraction. Around the age of 40 she recognized the emptiness of her life and sought God’s help in the Sacrament of Penance. Her Franciscan confessor helped Angela to seek God’s pardon for her previous life and to dedicate herself to prayer and the works of charity. Shortly after her conversion, her husband and children died. Selling most of her possessions, she entered the Secular Franciscan Order. She was alternately absorbed by meditating on the crucified Christ and by serving the poor of Foligno as a nurse and beggar for their needs. Other women joined her in a religious community. At her confessor’s advice, Angela wrote her Book of Visions and Instructions. In it she recalls some of the temptations she suffered after her conversion; she also expresses her thanks to God for the Incarnation of Jesus. This book and her life earned for Angela the title \"Teacher of Theologians.\" She was beatified in 1693, and canonized in 2013.</p><hr /><h3>St. Lucian(Priest and Martyr († 312))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT LUCIANPriest and Martyr( 312) St. Lucian was born at Samosata in Syria. Having lost his parents in his youth, he distributed all his worldly goods, of which he inherited an abundant share, to the poor, and withdrew to Edessa, to live near a holy man named Macarius, who imbued his mind with a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, and led him to the practice of the Christian virtues. Having become a priest, his time was divided between the external duties of his holy state, the performance of works of charity, and the study of sacred literature. He revised the books of the Old and New Testaments, expunging the errors which had found their way into the text either through the negligence of copyists or the malice of heretics, thus preparing the way for St. Jerome, who shortly after was to give to the world the Latin translation known as \"The Vulgate.\" Having been denounced as a Christian, Lucian was thrown into prison and condemned to torture, which was protracted for twelve whole days. Some Christian visited him in prison, on the feast of the Epiphany, and brought bread and wine to him; while bound and chained down on his back, he consecrated the divine mysteries upon his own breast, and communicated the faithful who were present. He finished his glorious career in prison, and died with the words, \"I am a Christian,\" on his lips.</p>"

Notwithstanding the great encomiums bestowed on him by Eusebius, St. Jerome, Theodoret, and others, but little is known of his actions; and his writings, which then were held in great esteem, seem now to be all lost. He wrote many able treatises against the heretics, and pointed out, as St. Jerome testifies, from what philosophical sect each heresy derived its errors. Nothing rendered his name so illustrious, however, as his noble apology for the Christian religion which he addressed to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, about the year 175, soon after the miraculous victory that prince had obtained over the Quadi by the prayers of the Christians. St. Apollinaris reminded the emperor of the benefit he had received from God through the prayers of his Christian subjects, and implored protection for them against the persecution of the pagans. Marcus Aurelius published an edict in which he forbade any one, under pain of death, to accuse a Christian on account of his religion; by a strange inconsistency, he had not the courage to abolish the laws then in force against the Christians, and, as a consequence, many of them suffered martyrdom, though their accusers were also put to death. The date of St. Apollinaris' death is not known; the Roman Martyrology mentions him on the 8th of January.</p><hr /><h3>St. Severin(Abbot (410-482))</h3><hr /><p>St. SeverinAbbot(410-482) Among the inhabitants of Noricum (now Austria), the abbot St. Severin who propagated the Gospel in that country, and is called its apostle.

Julian and Basilissa, though married, lived by mutual consent in perpetual chastity. They sanctified time by the perfect exercises of an ascetic life, and employed their revenue in relieving the poor and the sick. They converted their house into a hospital, which at one time housed nearly a thousand people. In the hospital, Basilissa attended the women and Julian attended the men, housed in separate quarters. From their charity, the Couple were dubbed Hospitalarians. Egypt, where they lived, had then begun abounding with examples of persons who, either in cities or deserts, devoted themselves to exercises of charity, penance, and mortification. St. Basilissa, after enduring seven persecutions, died in peace. St. Julian survived her many years, and also received the crown of martyrdom; together with Celsus, a youth, his mother, Marcianilla, Antony, a priest, and Anastasius. Many churches and hospitals in the East, and especially in the West, bear the name of one or other of these martyrs. Four churches at Rome, and three out of five at Paris, which bear the name of St. Julian, were originally dedicated under the name of St. Julian, the Hospitalarian and martyr. In the time of St. Gregory the Great, the skull of St. Julian was brought out of the East into France, and given to Queen Brunehault. She gave it to the nunnery which she founded at Étampes; part of it is at present in the monastery of Morigny, near Étampes, and part in the church of the regular canonesses of St. Basilissa at Paris.</p><hr /><h3>St. Adrian of Canterbury()</h3><hr />"

She attended school at the Monastery of the Visitation in the city of Troyes. There, Mother Marie de Sales Chappuis, the superior, and Father Louis Brisson, the chaplain, acted as her spiritual directors. Having thus been formed at the school of St. Francis de Sales, she prepared herself for the mission with which she was to be entrusted: the foundation of a Congregation committed to the Salesian spirituality and to the evangelization of young workers. The beginnings came in the year 1866. This was the time when large industrial concerns were attracting an underpaid labor force to the cities. This was also the case in the city of Troyes, where textile mills employed young, rural women. Fr. Brisson, a zealous apostle and one of the forerunners of the great social movement that developed at the end of the 19th century, had opened a center, in 1858, to welcome young girls working in the textile mills in order to give them a complete education, both human and Christian. Unable to find a suitable directress and a stable supervisory staff for this center, known as the \"Oeuvre Saint-François de Sales\", with God's inspiration, he decided to establish a religious congregation. He found in Léonie Aviat an incomparable co-worker, in whom he discerned a vocation to the consecrated life as well. Indeed, upon completing her studies, the young lady left the Visitation monastery with the firm intention of returning to it as a lay Sister. But Fr. Brisson and Mother Chappuis advised her to wait. Obedient to what she regarded as God's will, she received a special sign from Him a little later, one that couldn't be mistaken for an illusion: obliged to go to the factory, where glasses were manufactured and repaired, in Sézanne, her native city, an inspiration enlightened her mind and guided her decision. The sight of the workroom filled with young factory workers busily engaged in their work beneath the watchful and maternal gaze of a supervisor aroused in her heart the desire to take her place among them in order to counsel and guide them. This attraction would press her even more strongly the day that Fr. Brisson invited her to visit the \"Oeuvre ouvrière\" which he had founded in Troyes. On April 18, 1866, Leonie joined the \"Oeuvre Saint-François de Sales\", with one of her former classmates of the Visitation, Lucie Canuet. On October 30, 1868, the young foundress was clothed with the religious habit and received the name of Sister Françoise de Sales. This name was a sign indicating what would be her life's work, as she herself expressed it in the form of a prayer in her personal notes: \"St. Francis de Sales, you have chosen me to be at the head of this little group; give me your spirit, your heart... Grant me a share of your union with God and of that interior spirit which knows how to do everything in union with Him and nothing without Him\" (August, 1871). The \"little group\" which she guided placed itself under the protection of the saintly Bishop of Geneva and completely adopted his method of spirituality and of pedagogy; hence, the name that it chose for itself: the \"Oblate Sisters of St. Francis de Sales\", which means offered to God and to the neighbor by means of their whole life. On October 11, 1871, Sister Françoise de Sales professed her vows, and the following year, she was elected Superior General of the new Congregation which was thus canonically established and able to expand rapidly. Under her guidance, the community grew in numbers, and the social apostolate developed. At the same time, grade schools were opened in parishes, and in Paris the first boarding school for young ladies was also opened, an establishment which Mother Aviat directed for eight years. The apostolate of the Oblate Sisters thus extended to the different classes of society and to all forms of education, and, from the very first years of its foundation, to the missions ad gentes as well. In 1893, after a period of effacement which brought to light her humility, Mother Françoise de Sales was again elected Superior General, an office she held until her death. During this time, she endeavored to develop the apostolate of the Congregation in Europe, South Africa, and Ecuador, while lavishing her untiring solicitude on every community and on each of her Sisters. In 1903, she had to cope with the persecution directed against religious orders in France. While maintaining the houses of her Congregation that could be maintained in France, she transferred the Mother House to Perugia, Italy. In 1911, she secured the final approbation of the Constitutions of the Institute from Pope St. Pius X. On January 10, 1914, she died in Perugia with serenity, totally entrusting herself to God. To the very end, she remained faithful to the resolution made at the time of her Profession: \"To forget myself entirely\". To her daughters in every age, she left this very Salesian precept: \"Let us work for the happiness of others\". She was beatified on September 27, 1992 and canonized on November 25, 2001 at Rome by John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. William of Bourges(Archbishop († 1209))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT WILLIAM Archbishop( 1209) William Berruyer, of the illustrious family of the ancient Counts of Nevers, was educated by Peter the Hermit, Archdeacon of Soissons, his uncle by the mother's side. From his infancy, William learned to reject the world's vanity and emptiness, to think lightly of its pleasures, and to glorify God in both safety and danger. His singular delight was in exercises of piety; and his studying was also marked with the spirit and fervor of the Saints. He was made canon, first of Soissons and afterwards of Paris; but he soon resolved to abandon the world, and retired into the solitude of Grandmont, where he lived with great regularity in that austere Order until finally he joined the Cistercians, then in a state of sanctity. After some time, he was chosen Prior of the Abbey of Pontigny, and afterwards became Abbot of Chaalis. On the death of Henri de Sully, Archbishop of Bourges, William was chosen to succeed him. The announcement of this new dignity overwhelmed him, and he would not have accepted the office had not the Pope and his General, the Abbot of Citeaux, commanded him. Archbishop William's first care was conforming his intellect and will to the Divine; living by the rules of sanctity. He redoubled all his austerities, saying it was incumbent on him now to do penance for others as well as for himself. He always wore a hair-shirt under his religious habit, and never added to his clothing in winter or diminished it in summer. He never ate meat, though he had it at his table for strangers. When Archbishop William drew near his end, he was, at his request, laid on ashes in his hair-cloth, and in this posture passed away January 10, 1209. His body was interred in his cathedral, and, being honored by many miracles, was taken up in 1217. In the year following, St. William was canonized by Pope Honorius III.</p><hr /><h3>Bl.

Her parents, Tomas Rodríguez Sopeña and Nicolasa Ortega Salomon, had moved from Madrid to Velez Rubio for employment. Don Tomas had received his law degree at a young age, and because of this could not work as a lawyer. Instead, he found employment as an administrator of the Marqueses de Velez farms. She grew up in the Andalucía region where her father began to work as a magistrate, an even though he was transferred often, she defined this time of her life as a \"lake of tranquility\". In 1866, her father was named Judge of Almería. Dolores was 17, and was formally introduced to society, though she did not enjoy the parties or the social life. Her interest was in doing good for others. In Almería, she had her first apostolic experiences: she attended, materially and spiritually, to two sisters who had typhoid fever, and to a leper. She kept this hidden from her parents because she was afraid that they might forbid her from continuing her work. She also visited the poor of Saint Vicent de Paul with her mother. Three years later her father was sent to Puerto Rico. There he traveled with one of his sons while the rest of his family moved to Madrid. Dolores chose a spiritual advisor, and began teaching the Catholic doctrine to women in prison, in the Princess Hospital, and in the Sunday Schools. In 1872, the family reunited in Puerto Rico. Dolores was 23 years old and would remain in the Americas' until she was 28. She began her contact with the Jesuits and Father Goicoechea became her spiritual advisor. In Puerto Rico, she founded the Association of the Sodality of the Virgin Mary and the schools for the disadvantaged where she taught reading and writing, as well as catechism. In 1873, her father was named state attorney of Santiago de Cuba. These were difficult times, because a religious schism was raging on the island. Because of this, her actions were curtailed to visiting the sick in a military hospital. She requested admission into the Sister of Charity community but was not admitted due to her poor eye sight. At the age of 8, Dolores had an eye operation and this disability remained with her the rest of her life. At the conclusion of the schism, she began working in the poor neighborhoods and founded the \"Centers of Instruction\". There she taught catechism, general instruction, and provided medical assistance to those in need. For these efforts she was able to get much assistance and was able to establish the centers in three different neighborhoods. Her mother died in Cuba, and her father requested his retirement. The family returned to Madrid in 1877. In Madrid she organized her life on three fronts: her home and the care of her father, her apostolic work (the same work she did before leaving Spain) and her spiritual life (she chose a spiritual advisor and annually participated in Saint Ignatius Spiritual Retreat). In 1883 her father died, and once again she began to struggle with her vocation. At the advice of her spiritual advisor, Father López Soldado, S.I., she entered the convent of the Salesians, even though she had never thought of devoting her whole life to contemplation. After 10 days she left the convent as she came to the realization that this was not her vocation. She then began to give all of her attention to her apostolic work. In 1885, Dolores opened a center similar to modern social work centers. There, the poor and the needy were able to take their issues and concerns were addressed and resolved. During one of her visits, to one of the women prisoners that had just being released, she gets to know the neighborhood of the Injurias. When she saw the moral, material and spiritual condition of the people, she began visiting this neighborhood every week and invited many of her friends to help her with her work. There she began the organization \"Works of the Doctrines\", later named \"Center for the Workers\". In 1892, at the suggestion of the Bishop of Madrid, D. Ciríaco Sancha, she founded the Association of the Apostolic Laymen (which today is known as the Sopeña Lay Movement). The following year she received approval from the government which allowed her to expand her work to 8 neighborhoods of Madrid. In 1896 she began her activities outside Madrid. In 4 years she took 199 trips all over Spain to establish and consolidate the \"Works of the Doctrines\". At the same time she accompanied Father Tarin to Andalucía to help in the missions. In 1900, Dolores participated in a pilgrimage to Rome for the celebration of the Holy Year. There she took part in a retreat at the Saint Peter's tomb and received approval to establish a Religious Institute that would provide continuation of her \"Work of Doctrines\" and help to sustain spiritually the Sopeña Lay Movement. Cardinal Sancha, then Archbishop of Toledo, proposed founding it there. The \"Ladies of Catechistical Institute\" was founded On September 24, 1901. Dolores with 8 companions had just participated in Spiritual Exercises, in Loyola, where St. Ignatius was born and in the city of Toledo, on October 31 they started living as a religious community. One of the greatest inspirations that Dolores had was to establish at the same time, the Civil Association which today is known as OSCUS or Social & Cultural Work Sopeña. In 1902 the Association was officially recognized by the Spanish government. In 1905, the Institute received from the Holy See the Degree of Praise. Two years later, on November 21, 1907, Dolores received the approval directly from Pope Pius X. Today the Institute is known as the \"Sopeña Catechetical Institute\". During these years, her \"Works of the Doctrines\" were slowly changed to Centers for Workers' Instruction. These occurred because many of the workers that participated in the Centers were influenced by the anti-cleric sentiments and the instruction could not be called religious out right. The anti clerical sentiment was an important facet in the decision for the religious community of this Institute not to wear a 'habit' and did not to wear any outward sign of religion. These changes were made with the end result in mind: to get close to the workers who were \"alienated from the church\", that had been unable to receive any cultural, moral or religious instruction and to unite those socially distant. One of the main objectives of the centers were to bring people together to give them an opportunity to learn from each other. These encounters would result in mutual respect and a desire to help each other. Her deep faith, rich in spirituality was the reason for her commitment to the service to others. Her commitment to the dignity of people was born through her experience that God the Father of all, who loves us with infinite tenderness and who wishes for us to live as sons and brothers and sisters, was the driving force behind all that she did. From there, she had a great desire to \"Make of all, one family in Christ Jesus\". Her total immersion in Christ allowed her to see Him in everything and feel Him in everyone, especially in those that were in the most need of dignity and love. Towards the end of the 19th century, it was inconceivable to find a woman, who would go out to work in the poor neighborhood. The secret of her fearlessness was her deep faith, her confidence without limit. She recognized this as her greatest treasure, and it made her feel that she had become the instrument of God's work, the instrument of love, hope, dignity, and justice. In a few years, she was able to established communities and centers in industrialized cities. In 1910 the community celebrated the first General Chapter and Dolores was reelected Superior General. In 1914 she founded a community in Rome and in 1917 opened their first house in the Americas. The following year, on January 10, 1918, Dolores Sopeña died in Madrid. Talk had already began of her being a saint. On July 11, 1992, John Paul II declared Dolores' life work heroic and on April 23, 2002 he certified the miracle attributed to Dolores Sopeña which advanced her to beatification status. Currently the Sopeña Family which encompasses the three institutions founded by Dolores Sopeña are: the Sopeña Catechetical Institute, The Sopeña Lay Movement and the Sopeña Social and Cultural Work, can be found in Spain, Italy, Argentina, Colombia, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.</p>"

Eli, thinking her drunk,<br />said to her, \"How long will you make a drunken show of yourself? Sober up from your wine!\"<br />\"It isn't that, my lord,\" Hannah answered. \"I am an unhappy woman. I have had neither wine nor liquor; I was only pouring out my troubles to the LORD.<br />Do not think your handmaid a ne'er-do-well; my prayer has been prompted by my deep sorrow and misery.\"<br />Eli said, \"Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.\"<br />She replied, \"Think kindly of your maidservant,\" and left. She went to her quarters, ate and drank with her husband, and no longer appeared downcast.<br />Early the next morning they worshiped before the LORD, and then returned to their home in Ramah.

Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!\"<br />Jesus rebuked him and said, \"Quiet!

The example of Abraham urged Theodosius to leave his country, and his desire to follow Jesus Christ led him to the religious life. He placed himself under Longinus, a very holy hermit, who sent him to govern a monastery near Bethlehem. Unable to bring himself to command others, he fled to a cavern, where he lived in penance and prayer. His great charity, however, forbade him to refuse the charge of some disciples, who, though few at first, became in time a vast number; and Theodosius built a large monastery and three churches for them. He eventually became Superior of the religious communities of Palestine. Theodosius accommodated himself so carefully to the characters of his subjects that his reproofs were loved rather than dreaded. But once he was obliged to separate from the communion of the others a religious guilty of a grave fault. Instead of humbly accepting his sentence, the monk was arrogant enough to pretend to excommunicate Theodosius in revenge. Theodosius thought not of indignation, nor of his own position, but meekly submitted to this false and unjust excommunication. This so touched the heart of his disciple that he submitted at once and acknowledged his fault. Theodosius never refused assistance to any in poverty or affliction; on some days the monks laid more than a hundred tables for those in want. In times of famine Theodosius forbade the alms to be diminished, and often miraculously multiplied the provisions. He also built five hospitals, in which he lovingly served the sick, while by spiritual reading he maintained himself in perfect recollection. He successfully opposed the Eutychian heresy in Jerusalem, and for this was banished by the emperor. He suffered a long and painful malady, and refused to be cured, calling it a salutary penance for his former successes. He passed away at the age of a hundred and six.</p>"

His eyes had lately grown so weak that he could not see.<br />The lamp of God was not yet extinguished, and Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was.<br />The LORD called to Samuel, who answered, \"Here I am.\"<br />He ran to Eli and said, \"Here I am.

She was baptized in the church of Saint-Jean, near her home. Marguerite was the sixth of twelve children. Her parents were Abraham Bourgeoys and Guillemette Gamier; and she was privileged to grow up in a milieu that was middle class and Christian. Marguerite was nineteen when her mother passed away. The following year, in 1640, during the course of a procession held on October 7 in honor of Our Lady of the Rosary, she had an unforgettable experience. Her eyes rested on the statue of the Blessed Virgin, and at that moment she felt inspired to withdraw from the world and to consecrate herself to the service of God. With that unchanging fidelity to what she believed to be God's will for her, she set about discerning her specific vocation. She registered, at once, as a member of the extern Congregation of Troyes, an association of young girls devoted to the charitable work of teaching children in the poor districts of thetown. While conducting apostolate, she learned about the foundation of Ville Marie (Montreal) in Canada. The year was 1642; and at that time she sensed a first call to missionary life. This call was rendered concrete in 1652 when she met Monsieur de Maisonneuve, founder and governor of the settlement begun in New France, who was in search of someone to volunteer her services for the gratuitous instruction of the French and Native children. Our Lady confirmed the call addressed to her: \"Go, I will not forsake you,\" she said. Thus assured, Marguerite left Troyes in February 1653 with a spirit of complete detachment. She arrived in Montreal on the following November 16 and without delay set to work promoting the best interests of the community. She is rightly considered co-foundress of Montreal, with the nurse, Jeanne Mance, and the master designer, Monsieur de Maisonneuve. In order to encourage the community in expressing faith, she arranged for the restoration of the Cross on Mount Royal after it had been destroyed by hostile tribes, and she undertook the construction of a chapel dedicated to Notre-Dame de Bon Secours. Convinced of the family's importance, and the significance of the role played by women, she devoted herself to the task of for those with a vocation to motherhood. In 1658, in a stable which had been given to her by the governor for her use, she opened the first school in Montreal. She also organized an extern Congregation, patterned after the one in Troyes, but adapted to their needs. In this way, she could respond to the needs of women as far as the instruction of children were concerned. In 1659, she began receiving ladies who were recommended by \"les cures\" in France, or endowed by the King, to come to establish homes in Montreal, and she became a real mother to them. Thus were initiated a school system and a network of social services which gradually extended through the whole country, and which led people to refer to Marguerite as \"Mother of the Community\". On three occasions, Marguerite Bourgeoys made a trip to France to obtain help. In 1658, the group of teachers who associated themselves with her in the life of prayer, heroic detachment, and untiring devotedness to the service of others, presented the image of a religious institute. The group was inspired by the \"vie voyagere\" of Our Lady, and desired to remain uncloistered - the concept of an uncloistered community being an innovation at that time. Such a foundation occasioned much sacrifice, but the work progressed. The Congregation de Notre-Dame received its civil charter from Louis XIV in 1671, and canonical approbation by decree of the Bishop of Quebec in 1676. The Constitutions of the Community were approved in 1698. The foundation having been assured, Sister Bourgeoys could leave the work to others. She passed away in Montreal on January 12, 1700, acknowledged for her holiness of life. Her last generous act was to offer herself as a sacrifice of prayer for the return to health of a young Sister. Forty members of the Congregation de Notre-Dame were there to continue her work. The educative and apostolic efforts of Marguerite Bourgeoys continue through the members of the community that she founded. More than 2,600 Sisters of the Congregation de Notre-Dame work in fields of action according to the needs of time and place - from schools to colleges or universities, in the promotion of family, parish and diocesan activities. They are on mission in Canada, the United States, Japan, Latin America, Cameroon; and most recently, they have established a house in France. On November 12, 1950, Pope Pius XII beatified Marguerite Bourgeoys. Pope John Paul II canonized her on October 31, 1982 - giving the Canadian Church its first woman saint.</p><hr /><h3>St. Aelred(Abbot (1109-1167))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT AELRED OF RIEVAULX Abbot (1109-1167) \"One thing thou lackest.\" In these words God called Aelred from the court of a royal, David of Scotland, to the silence of the cloister. He left the king, the companions of his youth, and a friend most dear, to obey the call. Aelred was \"sent,\" and had conviction in the perils his soul faced in the world. Upon entering the Cistercian Order, his yearning for sympathy tempted him to forget a rule: In Aelred's case, the rule of perpetual silence. After breaking Simon's focus, Aelred prostrated himself to say sorry. He was repentant for not listening to others' hearts; and resolved to let nothing interupt his communion with God and Mary. At his superior's behest, Aelred composed his great works, the Spiritual Friendship and the Mirror of Charity. In the latter, he says that true love of God is only to be obtained by joining ourselves in all things to the Passion of Christ. \"Blessed are the meek, the poor in spirit... for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\" Aelred founded Rieveaux Abbey in England and served as its abbot. Before he passed away in 1167, he was superior of some three hundred monks.</p><hr /><h3>St. Benedict Biscop(abbot (c. 628 – 690))</h3><hr /><p></p>"

After a fierce struggle Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the battlefield.<br />When the troops retired to the camp, the elders of Israel said, \"Why has the LORD permitted us to be defeated today by the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the LORD from Shiloh that it may go into battle among us and save us from the grasp of our enemies.\"<br />So the people sent to Shiloh and brought from there the ark of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned upon the cherubim.

Born and educated a pagan, it was not till middle age that he embraced Christianity, moved thereto by God presented in the Holy Scriptures. He soon converted his wife and daughter, and detached himself from anti-Christian company. At the beginning of his conversion, St. Hilary would not eat with Jews or heretics, nor salute them by the way; but he relaxed his severity for their sake - like a mirror of Christ. He entered Holy Orders, and in 350 was chosen bishop of his native city. The Arian heresy, under the protection of Emperor Constantine, was then at the height of its power. St. Hilary supported the orthodox cause in several Gallic councils, where Arian bishops formed an overwhelming majority. In consequence, he was banished to Phrygia. He spent four years in exile composing his great Treatise on the Trinity and many others works. In 359, he attended the Council of Seleucia, in which Arians, semi-Arians, and Catholics contended for mastery. With the deputies of the council, he proceeded to Constantinople, and there so dismayed the heads of the Arian party that they prevailed upon the emperor to let him return to Gaul. He traversed Gaul, Italy, and Illyria, disproving heresies in their incompleteness and procuring the triumph of orthodoxy. \"Heresy sets the mood against the mind.\" After seven or eight years of missionary travel, St. Hilary returned to Poitiers, where he passed away peacefully in 368.</p><hr /><h3>St. Veronica of Binasco(Religious (c. 1445-1497))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT VERONICA OF BINASCO Religious (c. 1445-1497) Veronica's parents were peasants from a village near Milan. From childhood, Veronica toiled in the fields and home, but cheerfully performed every menial task. Gradually, the desire for perfection grew within her. She became deaf to the jokes and songs of her companions, and sometimes, would hide her face and weep. Knowing no letters, she began to be anxious about her learning, and rose secretly at night to teach herself to read. Our Lady told her that other things were necessary, but not this. She showed Veronica three mystical letters which would teach her more than books. The first signified purity of intention; the second, abhorrence of murmuring or criticism; the third, daily meditation on the Passion. By the first, she learned to begin her daily duties for no human motive, but God alone; by the second, she finished what she had begun by attending to her own affairs - never judging her neighbor, but praying for those who manifestly erred. By the third, she forgot her own pains and sorrows in those of the Lord - weeping hourly, but silently, for sins. She experienced ecstasies, and saw in successive visions the whole life of Jesus, and many other mysteries. Yet, by a special grace, neither her raptures nor her tears ever interrupted her labors. After three years' patient waiting, Veronica was received as a lay-sister in the convent of St. Martha at Milan. The community was extremely poor, and Veronica's duty was to beg through the city for their daily food. Three years after receiving the habit, she was afflicted with a secret but constant bodily pain, yet never consented to be relieved of her labors. By exact obedience, she became a living copy of the rule, and obeyed with a smile the least hint of her Superior. She sought the hardest and most humbling occupations, but through cheerful giving enjoyed the highest favors granted to the Saints. St. Veronica passed away in 1497, after a six-months illness, in the thirtieth year of her religious profession.</p>"

There must be a king over us.<br />We too must be like other nations, with a king to rule us and to lead us in warfare and fight our battles.\"<br />When Samuel had listened to all the people had to say, he repeated it to the LORD,<br />who then said to him, \"Grant their request and appoint a king to rule them.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>89(88),16-17.18-19.</em><p>Blessed the people who know the joyful shout; <br />in the light of your countenance, O LORD, they walk.<br />At your name they rejoice all the day, <br />and through your justice they are exalted.<br />For you are the splendor of their strength,<br />and by your favor our horn is exalted.<br />For to the LORD belongs our shield,<br />and to the Holy One of Israel, our King.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>2,1-12.</em><p>When Jesus returned to Capernaum after some days, it became known that he was at home.<br />Many gathered together so that there was no longer room for them, not even around the door, and he preached the word to them.<br />They came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.<br />Unable to get near Jesus because of the crowd, they opened up the roof above him. After they had broken through, they let down the mat on which the paralytic was lying.<br />When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Child, your sins are forgiven.\"<br />Now some of the scribes were sitting there asking themselves,<br />Why does this man speak that way? He is blaspheming. Who but God alone can forgive sins?<br />Jesus immediately knew in his mind what they were thinking to themselves, so he said, \"Why are you thinking such things in your hearts?<br />Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, pick up your mat and walk'?<br />But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority to forgive sins on earth\"--<br />he said to the paralytic, \"I say to you, rise, pick up your mat, and go home.\"<br />He rose, picked up his mat at once, and went away in the sight of everyone. They were all astounded and glorified God, saying, \"We have never seen anything like this.\"</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Peter Donders(Priest (1809-1887))</h3><p>Blessed Peter Donders Priest (1809-1887) Peter Donders was born in Tilburg (Holland), on October 27, 1809. From his youth, he felt himself called to the priesthood, but, because of the poverty of his family, his schooling was cut short. However, at the age of 22, with the help of his parish priest, he entered the minor seminary of St. Michael-Gestel as a seminarian. He was ordained on June 5, 1841. He was thus able to follow his missionary vocation, setting out for Suriname, which was then a Dutch colony. He arrived in Paramaribo, the principal city of the colony, on September 16, 1842 and applied himself at once to the pastoral works that were to occupy him until his death. His letters express his indignation at the harsh treatment of the African peoples forced to work on the plantations. In 1856, he was sent to the leper station of Batavia; and this was to be, with very few interruptions, the scene of his labors for the rest of his life. When the Redemptorists arrived in 1866 to take charge of the mission of Surinam, Peter Donders applied for admission into the Congregation. He professed his vows on June 24, 1867. Religious profession, in associating him with a missionary congregation, gave him a more vivid sense of the apostolic life in community, allowing him to leave Batavia more often to give himself to the conversion of the native Americans and Africans. But the name of Donders remained bound to the leprosarium of Batavia. He died among lepers, poor among the poor, on January 14, 1887, mourned as their benefactor and invoked as a saint. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II on May 23, 1982.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sava(Abbot and patron of Serbia (+ 1255))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT SAVA Abbot and Patron of Serbia(+ 1255) Sava was the son of Stephen I, founder of the Nemanydes dynasty. He became a monk on Mount Athos in Greece when he was seventeen. With his father, he founded Khilandrai Monastery on Mount Athos for Serbian monks, and became its Abbot. He returned home in 1207 when his brothers, Stephen II and Vulkan, began quarrelling and civil war broke out. Sava brought many of his monks with him, and from their headquarters at Studenitsa Monastery, he founded several monasteries and began the reformation and education of the country, where religion and education had fallen to a low state. He was named metropolitan of a new Serbian hierarchy by Emperor Theodore II Laskaris; and was unwillingly consecrated by Patriarch Manuel I. He returned in 1219, bringing more monks from Mount Athos. In 1222, he crowned his brother Stephen II King of Serbia. Through Sava's efforts, his countrymen were united. He translated religious works into Serbian, and gave his people a native clergy and hierarchy. After his second pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Fr. Sava passed away in Tirnovo, Bulgaria, on January 14. He is the patron Saint of Serbia.</p><hr /><h3>St. Felix of Nola()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

There was no other Israelite handsomer than Saul; he stood head and shoulders above the people.<br />Now the asses of Saul's father, Kish, had wandered off. Kish said to his son Saul, \"Take one of the servants with you and go out and hunt for the asses.\"<br />Accordingly they went through the hill country of Ephraim, and through the land of Shalishah. Not finding them there, they continued through the land of Shaalim without success. They also went through the land of Benjamin, but they failed to find the animals.<br />When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD assured him, \"This is the man of whom I told you; he is to govern my people.\"<br />Saul met Samuel in the gateway and said, \"Please tell me where the seer lives.\"<br />Samuel answered Saul: \"I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place and eat with me today. In the morning, before dismissing you, I will tell you whatever you wish.<br />Then, from a flask he had with him, Samuel poured oil on Saul's head; he also kissed him, saying: \"The LORD anoints you commander over his heritage. You are to govern the LORD'S people Israel, and to save them from the grasp of their enemies round about. \"This will be the sign for you that the LORD has anointed you commander over his heritage:</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>21(20),2-3.4-5.6-7.</em><p>O LORD, in your strength the king is glad; <br />in your victory how greatly he rejoices!<br />You have granted him his heart?s desire; <br />you refused not the wish of his lips.<br />For you welcomed him with goodly blessings, <br />you placed on his head a crown of pure gold.<br />He asked life of you: you gave him <br />length of days forever and ever.<br />Great is his glory in your victory; <br />majesty and splendor you conferred upon him.<br />You made him a blessing forever, <br />you gladdened him with the joy of your face.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>2,13-17.</em><p>Jesus went out along the sea. All the crowd came to him and he taught them.<br />As he passed by, he saw Levi, son of Alphaeus, sitting at the customs post. He said to him, \"Follow me.\" And he got up and followed him.<br />While he was at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners sat with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.<br />Some scribes who were Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors and said to his disciples, \"Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?\"<br />Jesus heard this and said to them (that), \"Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do. I did not come to call the righteous but sinners.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Paul(the first Hermit († 342))</h3><p>SAINT PAUL The First Hermit (c. 230-342) St. Paul was born in Upper Egypt, about the year 230, and became an orphan at the age of fifteen. He was very rich and highly educated. Fearing lest the tortures of a terrible persecution might endanger his Christian perseverance, he retired into a remote village. But his pagan brother-in-law denounced him, and St. Paul, rather than remain where his faith was in danger, entered the barren desert, trusting that God would supply his wants. And his confidence was rewarded; for on the spot to which Providence led him, he found the fruit of the palm-tree for food, and its leaves for clothing, and the water of a spring for drink. His first design was to return to the world when the persecution was over; but, tasting great delights in prayer and penance, he remained the rest of his life, ninety years, in penance, prayer, and contemplation. God revealed his existence to St. Antony, who sought him for three days. Seeing a thirsty she-wolf run through an opening in the rocks, St. Antony followed her to look for water, and found St. Paul. They knew each other at once, and praised God together. When St. Antony visited him, a raven brought him a loaf, and St. Paul said, \"See how good God is! For sixty years this bird has brought me half a loaf every day; now thou art come, Christ has doubled the provision for His servants.\" Having passed the night in prayer, at dawn St. Paul told St. Antony that he was about to die, and asked to be buried in a cloak given to St. Antony by St. Athanasius. St. Antony hastened to fetch it, and on his way back saw St. Paul rise to heaven in glory. He found St. Paul's dead body kneeling as if in prayer, with two lions digging his grave.</p><hr /><h3>St. Remigius(Archbishop (438-533))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT REMIGIUS Archbishop (438-533) St. Remigius, or Remi, was born of noble and pious parents. At the age of twenty-two, in spite of the canons and of his own reluctance, he was elected Archbishop of Rheims. He was unusually tall, his face impressed with blended majesty and serenity, his bearing gentle, humble, and retiring. He was learned and eloquent, and had the gift of miracles. His charity was boundless, and in toil he knew no weariness. His body was the outward expression of a noble and holy soul, with a spirit of meekness and compunction. For so choice a workman God had fitting work. The South of France was in the hands of Arians, and the pagan Franks were wresting the North from the Romans. St. Remigius confronted Clovis, king of the Franks, and converted and baptized him at Christmas, in 496. With Clovis, St. Remigius gained the whole Frank nation. St. Remi threw down the idol altars, built churches, and appointed bishops. He withstood and silenced the Arians, and converted so many that he left France a Catholic kingdom - its king was oldest, and at the time, the only crowned son of the Church. St. Remi passed away in 533 after an episcopate of seventy-four years, the longest on record.</p>"

My hour has not yet come.\"<br />His mother said to the servers, \"Do whatever he tells you.\"<br />Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washings, each holding twenty to thirty gallons.<br />Jesus told them, \"Fill the jars with water.\" So they filled them to the brim.<br />Then he told them, \"Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.\" So they took it.<br />And when the headwaiter tasted the water that had become wine, without knowing where it came from (although the servers who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter called the bridegroom<br />and said to him, \"Everyone serves good wine first, and then when people have drunk freely, an inferior one; but you have kept the good wine until now.\"<br />Jesus did this as the beginning of his signs in Cana in Galilee and so revealed his glory, and his disciples began to believe in him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Honoratus(Archbishop (+ 429))</h3><p>SAINT HONORATUSArchbishop(+ 429) St. Honoratus was of a consular Roman family settled in Gaul. In his youth, he renounced the worship of idols and gained his elder brother, Venantius, to Christ. Convinced of the hollowness of the things of this world, the brothers wished to renounce it, but a pagan father put continual obstacles in their way. At length, taking with them St. Caprais, a holy hermit, for their director, they sailed from Marseilles to Greece with the intention of living there unknown. Venantius passed away happily at Methone. Honoratus, falling sick, returned with St. Caprais. Honoratus first led a hermitical life in the mountains near Frejus. He then settled a small island now known as St. Honoré. About the year 400, he founded the famous monastery of Lerins. Some of his followers lived in community, while others lived in separate cells as anchorets. His rule was chiefly borrowed from St. Pachomius. Nothing can be more amiable than St. Hilary's description of this community, especially the charity, concord, humility, compunction, and devotion which reigned among them. St. Honoratus was consecrated Archbishop of Arles in 426. He passed away after extensive apostolic labors in 429.</p><hr /><h3>St. Marcellus(Pope and Martyr (+ 309))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARCELLUS I Pope and Martyr (+309) St. Marcellus was elected Pope in 307 during the last years of Diocletian's persecution.

Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.\" Saul replied, \"Speak!\"<br />Samuel then said: \"Though little in your own esteem, are you not leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king of Israel<br />and sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and put the sinful Amalekites under a ban of destruction. Fight against them until you have exterminated them.'<br />Why then have you disobeyed the LORD? You have pounced on the spoil, thus displeasing the LORD.\"<br />Saul answered Samuel: \"I did indeed obey the LORD and fulfill the mission on which the LORD sent me. I have brought back Agag, and I have destroyed Amalek under the ban.<br />But from the spoil the men took sheep and oxen, the best of what had been banned, to sacrifice to the LORD their God in Gilgal.\"<br />But Samuel said: \"Does the LORD so delight in holocausts and sacrifices as in obedience to the command of the LORD? Obedience is better than sacrifice, and submission than the fat of rams.<br />For a sin like divination is rebellion, and presumption is the crime of idolatry. Because you have rejected the command of the LORD, he, too, has rejected you as ruler.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>50(49),8-9.16bc-17.21.23.</em><p>\"Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you, <br />for your burnt offerings are before me always.<br />I take from your house no bullock, <br />no goats out of your fold.\"<br />\"Why do you recite my statutes,<br />and profess my covenant with your mouth,<br />Though you hate discipline <br />and cast my words behind you?\"<br />\"When you do these things, shall I be deaf to it? <br />Or do you think that I am like yourself? <br />I will correct you by drawing them up before your eyes. <br />He that offers praise as a sacrifice glorifies me; <br />and to him that goes the right way I will show the salvation of God.?</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>2,18-22.</em><p>The disciples of John and of the Pharisees were accustomed to fast. People came to Jesus and objected, \"Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?\"<br />Jesus answered them, \"Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.<br />But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.<br />No one sews a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloak. If he does, its fullness pulls away, the new from the old, and the tear gets worse.<br />Likewise, no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the skins are ruined. Rather, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Anthony the Abbot((251-356))</h3><p>SAINT ANTONY Patriarch of Monks (251-356) St. Antony was born in the year 251 in Upper Egypt. Hearing at Mass the words, \"If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor,\" he gave away all his vast possessions. He then begged an aged hermit to teach him the spiritual life. He also visited various solitaries, emulating the principal virtue of each. To serve God more perfectly, Antony entered the desert and immured himself in a ruin, building up the door so that none could enter. Here the fallen angels tempted and assailed him, appearing as various monsters, and even wounding him; but his courage never flagged, and he overcame them by the sign of the Cross. One night, whilst Antony was in solitude, many demons assailed him. A friend found him, and believing him dead, carried him home. But when Antony came to himself, he returned to his solitude. There, prostrate from weakness, Antony defied the demons, saying, \"I fear you not; you cannot separate me from the love of Christ.\" After more vain assaults, the devils fled, and Christ appeared to Antony in glory. Antony's only food was bread and water, which he never tasted before sunset, and sometimes only once in two, three, or four days. He wore sackcloth and sheepskin, and often knelt in prayer from sunset to sunrise. Many souls flocked to Antony for advice; and after twenty years of solitude, he consented to guide them in holiness - thus founding the first monastery. Antony's numerous miracles attracted such multitudes that he fled again into solitude, where he lived by manual labor. St. Antony passed away in the peace of the Holy Family. St. Athanasius, his biographer, says knowing how he lived is a good guide to virtue.</p>"

Saul will hear of it and kill me.\" To this the LORD answered: \"Take a heifer along and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'<br />Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I myself will tell you what to do; you are to anoint for me the one I point out to you.\"<br />Samuel did as the LORD had commanded him. When he entered Bethlehem, the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and inquired, \"Is your visit peaceful, O seer?\"<br />He replied: \"Yes! I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.

Not as man sees does God see, because man sees the appearance but the LORD looks into the heart.\"<br />Then Jesse called Abinadab and presented him before Samuel, who said, \"The Lord has not chosen him.\"<br />Next Jesse presented Shammah, but Samuel said, \"The LORD has not chosen this one either.\"<br />In the same way Jesse presented seven sons before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, \"The LORD has not chosen any one of these.\"<br />Then Samuel asked Jesse, \"Are these all the sons you have?\" Jesse replied, \"There is still the youngest, who is tending the sheep.\" Samuel said to Jesse, \"Send for him; we will not begin the sacrificial banquet until he arrives here.\"<br />Jesse sent and had the young man brought to them. He was ruddy, a youth handsome to behold and making a splendid appearance. The LORD said, \"There-anoint him, for this is he!\"<br />Then Samuel, with the horn of oil in hand, anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and from that day on, the spirit of the LORD rushed upon David.

He was baptized Manuel Barbal Cosan on January 2, 1898 in Enviny, a small town in the foothills of the Pyrenees in Catalonia, northern Spain. Known for his serious nature, he was only twelve when he entered the minor seminary of the diocese of La Seu de Urgel with the blessing of his devout and hardworking parents. He soon developed an ear infection and he was forced to abandon his studies for the priesthood. In 1917, convinced that God was calling him, he joined the noviciate of the La Salle Brothers in Irún. He took the name Jaime Hilario. After sixteen years in various teaching assignments, his increasing deafness forced him to abandon teaching. He moved to Cambrils, near Tarragona and worked in the garden of the Order's training house. On the outbreak of the Spanish civil war on July 18, 1936, he took refuge in nearby Mollerosa on his way to visit his family. But he was arrested as a religious and jailed. In December, he was transferred to Tarragona for trial. He was held on board a prison ship with several other brothers. On January 15, 1937, he was given a summary trial. Though he could have been freed by claiming to be only a gardener, he insisted on his identity as a religious. He was condemned to death on no grounds beyond his religious status. He was shot in a wood known as the Mount of Olives next to Tarragona cemetery on January 18, 1937. His last words to his executioners were \"My friends, to die for Christ is to reign.\" When two volleys failed to meet their mark, the soldiers dropped their rifles and fled in panic. The commander, shouting a furious oath, fired five shots to the temple and the victim fell at his feet. He was the first of 97 Christian Brothers killed in Catalonia during the Spanish civil war. He was beatified on April 29, 1990 and canonized on November 21, 1999 by Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Priscilla()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>St. Volusian()</h3><hr />"

There was a man there who had a withered hand.<br />They watched him closely to see if he would cure him on the sabbath so that they might accuse him.<br />He said to the man with the withered hand, \"Come up here before us.\"<br />Then he said to them, \"Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil, to save life rather than to destroy it?\" But they remained silent.<br />Looking around at them with anger and grieved at their hardness of heart, he said to the man, \"Stretch out your hand.\" He stretched it out and his hand was restored.<br />The Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him to put him to death.</p><hr /><h3>St. Canutus(King of Denmark(1040-1086))</h3><p>SAINT CANUTUS King of Denmark and Martyr (1040-1086) St. Canutus, King of Denmark, was endowed with excellent qualities of both mind and body. It is hard to say whether he excelled more in courage or in conduct and skill in war; but his singular piety eclipsed all his other endowments. He cleared the seas of pirates, and subdued several neighboring provinces which infested Denmark with their incursions. The kingdom of Denmark was elective till the year 1660, and, when the father of Canutus died, his eldest brother, Harold, was called to the throne. Harold died after reigning for two years, and Canutus was chosen to succeed him. He began his reign by a successful war against the troublesome, barbarous enemies of the state, and by planting the faith in conquered provinces. Amid the glory of his victories, he humbly prostrated himself at the foot of the crucifix, laying there his diadem, and offering himself and his kingdom to the King of kings. After providing for the peace and safety of his country, he married Eltha, daughter of Robert, Earl of Flanders. His next concern was enforcing laws which repressed violence and tyranny without respect to persons. He honored holy men, and granted privileges to the clergy. His charity and tenderness towards his subjects made him study all possible ways to make them happy. He showed a royal munificence in building and adorning churches, and gave the crown which he wore to a church in his capitol and place of residence, where the kings of Denmark are still buried. To the virtues which constitute a great king, St. Canutus added those which prove a great saint. When a rebellion sprung up in his kingdom, he was surprised at church by the rebels. Perceiving the danger, he confessed his sins at the foot of the altar, and received Holy Communion. Stretching out his arms, the Saint recommended his soul to his Creator. In this posture, he was struck by a javelin thrown through a window, and fell a victim for Christ's sake.</p><hr /><h3>St. Wulfstan()</h3><hr />"

All that remains for him is the kingship.\"<br />(And from that day on, Saul was jealous of David.<br />Saul discussed his intention of killing David with his son Jonathan and with all his servants. But Saul's son Jonathan, who was very fond of David,<br />told him: \"My father Saul is trying to kill you. Therefore, please be on your guard tomorrow morning; get out of sight and remain in hiding.<br />I, however, will go out and stand beside my father in the countryside where you are, and will speak to him about you. If I learn anything, I will let you know.\"<br />Jonathan then spoke well of David to his father Saul, saying to him: \"Let not your majesty sin against his servant David, for he has committed no offense against you, but has helped you very much by his deeds.<br />When he took his life in his hands and slew the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel through him, you were glad to see it. Why, then, should you become guilty of shedding innocent blood by killing David without cause?\"<br />Saul heeded Jonathan's plea and swore, \"As the LORD lives, he shall not be killed.\"<br />So Jonathan summoned David and repeated the whole conversation to him. Jonathan then brought David to Saul, and David served him as before.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>56(55),2-3.9-10a.10b-11.12-13.</em><p>Have mercy on me, O God, for men trample upon me;<br />all the day they press their attack against me.<br />My adversaries trample upon me all the day;<br />yes, many fight against me.<br />My wanderings you have counted;<br />my tears are stored in your flask;<br />are they not recorded in your book?<br />Then do my enemies turn back,<br />when I call upon you.<br />Now I know that God is with me.<br />In God, in whose promise I glory,<br />in God I trust without fear;<br />what can flesh do against me?<br />I am bound, O God, by vows to you;<br />your thank offerings I will fulfill.<br />For you have rescued me from death,<br />my feet, too, from stumbling;<br />that I may walk before God in the light of the living.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>3,7-12.</em><p>Jesus withdrew toward the sea with his disciples. A large number of people followed from Galilee and from Judea.<br />Hearing what he was doing, a large number of people came to him also from Jerusalem, from Idumea, from beyond the Jordan, and from the neighborhood of Tyre and Sidon.<br />He told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not crush him.<br />He had cured many and, as a result, those who had diseases were pressing upon him to touch him.<br />And whenever unclean spirits saw him they would fall down before him and shout, \"You are the Son of God.\"<br />He warned them sternly not to make him known.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sebastian(Martyr (c. 257-c. 288))</h3><p>SAINT SEBASTIAN Martyr (c. 257-c. 288) St. Sebastian was an officer in the Roman army, esteemed by pagans as a good soldier, and honored by the Church as a champion of Jesus Christ. Born at Narbonne, France, Sebastian came to Rome about the year 284. There, he found twin brothers Marcus and Marcellinus in prison for the faith, and when they were near yielding to entreaties, encouraged them to despise flesh and blood and die to themselves for Christ. God confirmed his words by miracle: light shone around him while he spoke; he cured the sick by his prayers; and in this divine strength led many to the faith, among them the Prefect of Rome, with his son Tiburtius. Sebastian saw his disciples die before him, and one of them came back in vision to tell him that his own end was near. It was during a contest of fervor and charity that St. Sebastian found the occasion of martyrdom.The Prefect of Rome, after his conversion, retired to his estates in Campania, and took a great number of his fellow-converts with him to this place of safety. It was a question of whether Polycarp, a priest, or St. Sebastian should accompany the neophytes. Both were eager to stay and face the danger at Rome, but at last the Pope decided that the Roman church could not spare Sebastian's services. Thus St. Sebastian continued to labor at his post till he was betrayed by a false disciple. He was led before Diocletian, and at the emperor's command, was shot with arrows and left for dead. But God raised him up; and of his own accord, he went before the emperor and conjured him to stay the persecution of the Church. Again sentenced, St. Sebastian was at last beaten to death by clubs - crowning his labors by the merit of a double martyrdom.</p><hr /><h3>St. Fabian(Pope and Martyr (+ 250))</h3><hr />"

David and his men were occupying the inmost recesses of the cave.<br />David's servants said to him, \"This is the day of which the LORD said to you, 'I will deliver your enemy into your grasp; do with him as you see fit.'\" So David moved up and stealthily cut off an end of Saul's mantle.<br />Afterward, however, David regretted that he had cut off an end of Saul's mantle.<br />He said to his men, \"The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD'S anointed, as to lay a hand on him, for he is the Lord's anointed.\"<br />With these words David restrained his men and would not permit them to attack Saul. Saul then left the cave and went on his way.<br />David also stepped out of the cave, calling to Saul, \"My lord the king!\" When Saul looked back, David bowed to the ground in homage<br />and asked Saul: \"Why do you listen to those who say, 'David is trying to harm you'?<br />You see for yourself today that the LORD just now delivered you into my grasp in the cave. I had some thought of killing you, but I took pity on you instead. I decided, 'I will not raise a hand against my lord, for he is the LORD'S anointed and a father to me.'<br />Look here at this end of your mantle which I hold. Since I cut off an end of your mantle and did not kill you, see and be convinced that I plan no harm and no rebellion. I have done you no wrong, though you are hunting me down to take my life.<br />The LORD will judge between me and you, and the LORD will exact justice from you in my case.

Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog, or a single flea!<br />The LORD will be the judge; he will decide between me and you. May he see this, and take my part, and grant me justice beyond your reach!\"<br />When David finished saying these things to Saul, Saul answered, \"Is that your voice, my son David?\" And he wept aloud.<br />Saul then said to David: \"You are in the right rather than I; you have treated me generously, while I have done you harm.<br />Great is the generosity you showed me today, when the LORD delivered me into your grasp and you did not kill me.<br />For if a man meets his enemy, does he send him away unharmed? May the LORD reward you generously for what you have done this day.<br />And now, since I know that you shall surely be king and that sovereignty over Israel shall come into your possession.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>57(56),2.3-4.6.11.</em><p>Have mercy on me, God, have mercy on me. <br />In you I seek shelter.<br />In the shadow of your wings I seek shelter <br />till harm pass by.<br />I call to God Most High, <br />to God who provides for me.<br />May God send help from heaven to save me, <br />shame those who trample upon me. <br />May God send fidelity and love.<br />Be exalted over the heavens, O God; <br />may your glory appear above all the earth.<br />For your mercy towers to the heavens, <br />and your faithfulness to the skies.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>3,13-19.</em><p>Jesus went up the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted and they came to him.<br />He appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) that they might be with him and he might send them forth to preach<br />and to have authority to drive out demons:<br />(he appointed the twelve:) Simon, whom he named Peter;<br />James, son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, whom he named Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;<br />Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus, Simon the Cananean,<br />and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Agnes((+ 304))</h3><p>SAINT AGNES Virgin and Martyr (+ 304) St. Agnes was twelve years old when she was led to the altar of Minerva at Rome and commanded to offer incense by the laws of Diocletian. In the midst of the idolatrous rites, she raised her hands to Jesus Christ, her Spouse, and made the sign of the Cross. She did not shrink after being bound hand and foot, though the gyves slipped from her young hands, and the pagans standing around were moved to tears. The bonds were not needed as she walked courageously to the place of torture. \"Perfect love casts out fear\" (Jn 4:18). When the judge saw that pain had no terrors for St. Agnes, he inflicted an insult: Her clothes were stripped off, and she stood in the street before a pagan crowd; but she remained undaunted. \"Christ,\" she said, \"will guard His own.\" So it was: Christ showed, by a miracle, the value which He sets upon the custody of the eyes. Whilst the crowd turned away, there was one young man who dared to gaze at the innocent child with immodest eyes. A flash of light struck him blind, and his companions bore him away half dead with pain and terror. St. Agnes was afterward tempted with flattery and an exalted marriage. But she answered, \"Christ is my Spouse: He chose me first, and His I will be.\" At length, the sentence of death was passed. For a moment, she stood erect in prayer, and then bowed her neck to the sword. At one stroke, her head was severed from her body, and the angels bore her pure soul to Paradise.</p>"

As punishment for being Christian, Valerian was banished and Vincent was condemned to death by torture. First, St. Vincent was stretched on the rack; and when almost torn asunder, was mocked for resisting. St. Vincent was alive in love for Jesus Christ, so Dacian goaded his executioners to redouble the torture. St. Vincent's flesh was torn with hooks. Later, he was fastened to a chair of red-hot iron. Afterward, lard and salt were rubbed into his wounds. Amidst the torture, St. Vincent kept his eyes raised to heaven - remaining unmoved. St. Vincent was at length cast into a solitary dungeon with his feet in the stocks; but the angels of Christ illuminated the darkness, and assured St. Vincent that he was near triumph. After the apparitions, St. Vincent's wounds were tended to prepare him for fresh torture; and others were permitted to see his mangled body. Those who beheld St. Vincent kissed him and carried away cloths dipped in his blood as relics.Before the tortures recommenced, St. Vincent's hour came; and he breathed forth his soul to God. The dead bodies of the saints are precious in the sight of God, and the hand of iniquity cannot touch them. A raven guarded the body of St. Vincent where it lay flung upon the earth. When his body was sunk out at sea, the waves carried it ashore; and his relics are preserved to this day in the Augustinian monastery at Lisbon.</p>"

Her courage helped tremendously to improve the lives of its victims in Hawaii, a territory annexed to the United States during her lifetime (1898). Mother Marianne’s generosity and courage were celebrated at her May 14, 2005, beatification in Rome. She was a woman who spoke “the language of truth and love”, said Cardinal José Saraiva Martins, prefect of the Congregation for Saints’ Causes. Cardinal Martins, who presided at the beatification Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica, called her life “a wonderful work of divine grace.” Speaking of her special love for persons suffering from leprosy, he said, “She saw in them the suffering face of Jesus. Like the Good Samaritan, she became their mother.” On January 23, 1838, a daughter was born to Peter and Barbara Cope of Hessen-Darmstadt, Germany. The girl was named after her mother. Two years later, the Cope family emigrated to the United States and settled in Utica, New York. Young Barbara worked in a factory until August 1862, when she went to the Sisters of the Third Order of Saint Francis in Syracuse, New York. After profession in November of the next year, she began teaching at Assumption parish school. Sr. Marianne held the post of superior in several places and was twice the novice mistress of her congregation. A natural leader, three different times she was superior of St. Joseph’s Hospital in Syracuse, where she learned much that would be useful during her years in Hawaii. Elected provincial in 1877, Mother Marianne was unanimously re-elected in 1881. Two years later, the Hawaiian government was searching for someone to run the Kakaako Receiving Station for people suspected of having leprosy. More than 50 religious communities in the United States and Canada were asked. When the request was put to the Syracuse sisters, 35 of them volunteered immediately. On October 22, 1883, Mother Marianne and six other sisters left for Hawaii where they took charge of the Kakaako Receiving Station outside Honolulu. On the island of Maui, they also opened a hospital and a school for girls. In 1888, Mother Marianne and two sisters went to Molokai to open a home for “unprotected women and girls.” The Hawaiian government was quite hesitant to send women for this difficult assignment. They need not have worried about Mother Marianne! On Molokai, she took charge of the home thatSt. Damien de Veuster [May 10, d. 1889] had established for men and boys. Mother Marianne changed life on Molokai by introducing cleanliness, pride and fun to the colony. Bright scarves and pretty dresses for the women were part of her approach. Awarded the Royal Order of Kapiolani by the Hawaiian government, and celebrated in a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson, Mother Marianne continued her work faithfully. Her sisters have attracted vocations among the Hawaiian people and still work on Molokai. In 2005, Mother Marianne Cope was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI.[1] St. Marianne was declared a saint on October 21, 2012.</p><hr /><h3>St. John the Almoner(Patriarch of Alexandria (+ c. 620))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT JOHN THE ALMONERPatriarch of Alexandria(+ c. 620) St. John was married, but when his wife and two children passed away, he answered God's call to lead a perfect life. He gave away all his possessions in alms and became known throughout the East as the Almoner. When he was appointed Patriarch of Alexandria, he told his servants to go into the city and bring him a list of his Lords' - meaning: the poor. They brought word that there were seventy-five hundred, and these he undertook to feed every day. On Wednesday and Friday every week, he sat on a bench in front of the church to hear the complaints of the needy and aggrieved. The fear of death was ever before him, and he never spoke an idle word. He turned those out of church whom he saw talking, and forbade unrepentant sinners from entering his house. He left seventy churches in Alexandria, where he had found but seven. St. John passed away in Cyprus, his native place, about the year 620.</p>"

When the Duke of Savoy resolved to restore the Church in the Chablais, St. Francis offered himself for the work and set out on foot with his Bible and breviary and one companion: his cousin, Louis of Sales. It was a work of toil, privation, and danger. Every door and every heart was closed against him. He was rejected with insult and threatened with death. But nothing could daunt him, and ere long the Church burst forth into a second spring. It is stated that he converted 72,000 Calvinists. St. Francis was then compelled by the Pope to become Coadjutor Bishop of Geneva, and succeeded to the see in 1602. At times, the exceeding gentleness with which he received heretics and sinners almost scandalized his friends, and one of them said to him, \"Francis of Sales will go to Paradise, of course; but I am not so sure of the Bishop of Geneva. I am almost afraid his gentleness will play him a shrewd turn.\" \"Ah,\" said the Saint, \"I would rather account to God for too great gentleness than for too great severity. Is not God all love? God the Father is the Father of mercy; God the Son is a Lamb; God the Holy Spirit is a Dove - that is, gentleness itself. And are you wiser than God?\" In union with St. Jane Frances of Chantal, he founded at Annecy the Order of the Visitation, which soon spread over Europe. Though poor, he was loyal to God and his vocation; refusing excess provisions, dignities, and the great see of Paris. He passed away at Avignon in 1622. \"Goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever\" (Ps. 23:6).</p>"

José Gabriel Brochero()</h3><p>BLESSED JOSE GABRIEL BROCHERO Priest (1840 - 1914) José Gabriel del Rosario Brochero was born on the outskirts of Santa Rosa de Rio Primero, Cordoba, on March 16, 1840. He was the fourth of 10 children, who lived from their father’s rural work. He grew up in a profoundly Christian family. Two of his sisters were nuns of the Garden of Olives. Having entered the College Seminary of Our Lady of Loreto on March 5, 1856, he was ordained a priest on Nov. 4, 1866. As an assistant in the pastoral tasks of the Cathedral of Cordoba, he carried out his priestly ministry during the cholera epidemic that devastated the city. Being Prefect of Studies of the Major Seminary, he received the title of Master in Philosophy from the University of Cordoba. At the end of 1869, he took on the extensive parish of Saint Albert of 4,336 square kilometers (1,675 square miles), with just over 10,000 inhabitants who lived in distant places with no roads or schools, cut off by the Great Highlands of more than 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) of altitude. The moral state and material indigence of its inhabitants was lamentable. However, Brochero’s apostolic heart was not discouraged, but from that moment on he dedicated his whole life not only to bring the Gospel to the inhabitants but to educate and promote them. The year after arriving, he began to take men and women to Cordoba to do the Spiritual Exercises. It took three days on the back of a mule to cover the 200 kilometers (125 miles), in caravans that often exceeded 500 people. More than once they were surprised by strong snow storms. On returning, after nine days in silence, prayer and penance, his faithful began to change their lives, following the Gospel and working for the economic development of the region. In 1875, with the help of his faithful, he began the building of the Houses of Exercises of the then Villa del Transito (locality that today is named after him). It was inaugurated in 1877 with groups that exceeded 700 people, a total of more than 40,000 going through it during his parish ministry. As a complement, he built the House for women religious, the Girls’ School and the residence for priests. With his faithful he built more than 200 kilometers of roads and several churches. He founded villages and was concerned about the education of all. He requested and obtained from the authorities courier posts, post offices and telegraphic posts. He planned the rail network that would go through the Valley of Traslasierra joining Villa Dolores and Soto to bring the beloved highlanders out of the poverty in which they found themselves, “abandoned by all but not by God,” as he said. He preached the Gospel, using the language of his faithful to make it comprehensible to his listeners. He celebrated the sacraments, always carrying what was necessary for the Mass on the back of his mule. No sick person was left without the sacraments, as neither the rain nor the cold stopped him. “Woe if the devil is going to rob a soul from me,” he said. He gave himself totally to all, especially the poor and the estranged, whom he sought diligently to bring them close to God. A few days after his death, the Catholic newspaper of Cordoba wrote: “It is known that Father Brochero contracted the sickness that took him to his tomb, because he visited at length and embraced an abandoned leper of the area.” Because of his illness, he gave up the parish, living a few years with his sisters in his native village. However, responding to the request of his former faithful, he returned to his House of Villa del Transito, dying leprous and blind on Jan. 26, 1914. José Gabriel Brochero was beatified in September 2013 by Pope Francis.</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Timothy and Titus(Bishops - Memorial)</h3><hr /><p>SAINTS TIMOTHY AND TITUS Bishops and Disciples of St. Paul (1st century) St. Timothy was a convert of St. Paul. He was born at Lystra in Asia Minor. His mother was a Jewess, but his father was a pagan; and though Timothy had read the Scriptures from his childhood, he had not been circumcised as a Jew. On the arrival of St. Paul at Lystra, the youthful Timothy, with his mother and grandmother, eagerly embraced the faith. Seven years later, when the Apostle again visited the country, the boy had grown into manhood, while his good heart, his austerities and zeal had won the esteem of all around him; and holy men were prophesying great things of the fervent youth. St. Paul at once saw his fitness for the work of an evangelist. Timothy was forthwith ordained, and from that time became the constant and much-beloved fellow-worker of the Apostle. In company with St. Paul, he visited the cities of Asia Minor and Greece - at one time hastening on in front as a trusted messenger, at another lingering behind to confirm in the faith some recently founded church. Finally, he was made the first Bishop of Ephesus; and here he received the two epistles which bear his name, the first written from Macedonia and the second from Rome, in which St. Paul from his prison gives vent to his longing desire to see his \"dearly beloved son,\" if possible, once more before his death. St. Timothy himself, not many years after the death of St. Paul, won his martyr's crown at Ephesus. As a child, Timothy delighted in reading the sacred books, and to his last hour he would remember the parting words of his spiritual father, \"Attende lectioni-Apply thyself to reading.\"************************ St. Titus was a convert from paganism, a disciple of St. Paul, one of the chosen companions of the Apostles in his journey to the Council of Jerusalem, and his fellow-laborers in many apostolic missions. From the Second Epistle which St. Paul sent by the hand of Titus to the Corinthians, we gain an insight into his character and the affection which his master bore. Titus had been commissioned to carry out a twofold office which needed much firmness, discretion, and charity. He was to be the bearer of a severe rebuke to the Corinthians, who were giving scandal and were wavering in their faith; and at the same time he was to put their charity to a further test by calling upon them for abundant alms for the church at Jerusalem. St. Paul, meanwhile, was anxiously awaiting the result. At Troas, St. Paul writes, \"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother.\" He set sail to Macedonia. Here at last, Titus brought the good news. His success had been complete. He reported the sorrow, the zeal, and the generosity of the Christians, till the Apostle could not contain his joy, and sent back to them his faithful messenger with the letter of comfort from which we have quoted. Titus was finally left as a bishop in Crete, and here he, in turn, received the epistle which bears his name, and here at last he died in peace. The mission of Titus to Corinth shows us how well the disciple caught the spirit of his master. He knew how to be firm and to inspire respect. The Corinthians, we are told, \"received him with fear and trembling.\" He was patient and painstaking. St. Paul \"gave thanks to God, Who had put such carefulness for them in the heart of Titus.\" And these gifts were enhanced by a quickness to detect and call out all that was good in others, and by a joyousness which overflowed upon the spirit of St. Paul himself, who \"abundantly rejoiced in the joy of Titus.\"</p>"

Hence Angela saw her vocation as the formation of Christian women.

David, however, remained in Jerusalem.<br />One evening David rose from his siesta and strolled about on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing, who was very beautiful.<br />David had inquiries made about the woman and was told, \"She is Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, and wife of (Joab's armor-bearer) Uriah the Hittite.\"<br />Then David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he had relations with her. She then returned to her house.<br />But the woman had conceived, and sent the information to David, \"I am with child.\"<br />David therefore sent a message to Joab, \"Send me Uriah the Hittite.\" So Joab sent Uriah to David.<br />When he came, David questioned him about Joab, the soldiers, and how the war was going, and Uriah answered that all was well.<br />David then said to Uriah, \"Go down to your house and bathe your feet.\" Uriah left the palace, and a portion was sent out after him from the king's table.<br />But Uriah slept at the entrance of the royal palace with the other officers of his lord, and did not go down to his own house.<br />David was told that Uriah had not gone home. On the day following,<br />David summoned him, and he ate and drank with David, who made him drunk. But in the evening he went out to sleep on his bed among his lord's servants, and did not go down to his home.<br />The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab which he sent by Uriah.<br />In it he directed: \"Place Uriah up front, where the fighting is fierce. Then pull back and leave him to be struck down dead.\"<br />So while Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew the defenders were strong.<br />When the men of the city made a sortie against Joab, some officers of David's army fell, and among them Uriah the Hittite died.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>51(50),3-4.5-6a.6bc-7.10-11.</em><p>Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; <br />in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.<br />Thoroughly wash me from my guilt <br />and of my sin cleanse me.<br />For I acknowledge my offense, <br />and my sin is before me always:<br />\"Against you only have I sinned,<br />and done what is evil in your sight.\"<br />That you may be justified in your sentence,<br />vindicated when you condemn.<br />Indeed, in guilt was I born,<br />and in sin my mother conceived me.<br />Let me hear sounds of joy and gladness; <br />let the bones you have crushed rejoice.<br />Turn away your face from my sins, <br />and blot out all my guilt.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>4,26-34.</em><p>Jesus said to the crowds: \"This is how it is with the Kingdom of God; it is as if a man were to scatter seed on the land<br />and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow, he knows not how.<br />Of its own accord the land yields fruit, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.<br />And when the grain is ripe, he wields the sickle at once, for the harvest has come.\"<br />He said, \"To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use for it?<br />It is like a mustard seed that, when it is sown in the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on the earth.<br />But once it is sown, it springs up and becomes the largest of plants and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the sky can dwell in its shade.\"<br />With many such parables he spoke the word to them as they were able to understand it.<br />Without parables he did not speak to them, but to his own disciples he explained everything in private.</p><hr /><h3>St. Thomas Aquinas(Priest & Doctor of the Church (+ 1274) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINT THOMAS AQUINAS Priest and Doctor of the Church (c. 1225-1274) St. Thomas was born of noble parents in Aquino, Italy. At the age of nineteen, he received the Dominican habit at Naples where he was studying. Disapproving of his vocation, St. Thomas' brothers seized him while he was on the way to Paris; and held him fortwo years' captivity in their castle of Rocca-Secca. Despite the threats and stratagems of his brothers, and the tears and caresses of his mother and sisters, St. Thomas remained steadfast, and proved his virtue of fortitude. While St. Thomas was in confinement at Rocca-Secca, his brothers endeavored to entrap him into sin, but the attempt only ended in the triumph of his purity. Snatching from the hearth a burning brand, the Saint drove from his chamber a woman whom they had there concealed. Then marking a cross upon the wall, he knelt down to pray, and forthwith, being rapt in ecstasy, an angel girded him with a cord, in token of the gift of perpetual chastity which God had given him. The pain caused by the girdle was so sharp that St. Thomas uttered a piercing cry, which brought his guards into the room. But he never told this grace to any one save only to Father Raynald, his confessor, a little while before his death. Hence originated the Confraternity of the \"Angelic Warfare,\" for the preservation of the virtue of chastity. Having at length escaped, St. Thomas went to Cologne to study under Blessed Albert the Great, and after that to Paris, where for many years he taught philosophy and theology. The Church has ever venerated his numerous writings as a treasure-house of sacred doctrine; while in naming him the Angelic Doctor, She has indicated that his science is more divine than human. The rarest gifts of intellect were combined in him with the tenderest piety. Prayer, he said, had taught him more than study. His singular devotion to the Blessed Sacrament shines forth in the Office and hymns for Corpus Christi, which he composed. To the words miraculously uttered by a crucifix at Naples, \"Well hast thou written concerning Me, Thomas. What shall I give thee as a reward?\" he replied, \"Naught save Thyself, O Lord.\" He passed away at Fossa-Nuova, 1274, on his way to the General Council of Lyons, to which Pope Gregory X had summoned him.</p>"

It is not jealous, (love) is not pompous, it is not inflated,<br />it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury,<br />it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.<br />It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br />Love never fails. If there are prophecies, they will be brought to nothing; if tongues, they will cease; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.<br />For we know partially and we prophesy partially,<br />but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.<br />When I was a child, I used to talk as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became a man, I put aside childish things.<br />At present we see indistinctly, as in a mirror, but then face to face. At present I know partially; then I shall know fully, as I am fully known.<br />So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>4,21-30.</em><p>Jesus began speaking in the synagogue saying: \"Today this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing.\"<br />And all spoke highly of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his mouth.<br />He said to them, \"Surely you will quote me this proverb, 'Physician, cure yourself,' and say, 'Do here in your native place the things that we heard were done in Capernaum.'\"<br />And he said, \"Amen, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own native place.<br />Indeed, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was closed for three and a half years and a severe famine spread over the entire land.<br />It was to none of these that Elijah was sent, but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon.<br />Again, there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.\"<br />When the people in the synagogue heard this, they were all filled with fury.<br />They rose up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town had been built, to hurl him down headlong.<br />But he passed through the midst of them and went away.</p><hr /><h3>St. Bathildes(Queen (c. 634-680))</h3><p>SAINT BATHILDES Queen. (c. 634-680) St. Bathildes was an Anglo Saxon slave who became a Christian queen. She was sold at a very young age to Erkenwald, mayor of the palace under King Clovis II. When she grew up, Erkenwald was so taken with her prudence and virtue that he placed her in charge of his household. The renown of St. Bathildes' spirit, fervor and virtues spread through all France; and King Clovis II took her for his royal consort. This unexpected marriage produced no alteration in her heart, which she kept under 7 locks: Chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness, and humility. It is certain that great, Holy Angels assist in the keeping and growth of each virtue. \"You will see the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man\" (Jn 1:51). \"The kingdom of God is like a mustard seed ... Once it is sown, it springs up and becomes the largest of plants and puts forth large branches\" (Mk 4:26-34). In her bravery, truthfulness and unselfishness, King Clovis II gave Queen Bathildes royal authority for the protection of the Church, care of the poor, and furtherance of religious undertakings. King Clovis' death left Queen Bathildes regent of the kingdom: She forbade the enslavement of Christians, did all in her power to promote piety, and filled France with hospitals and religious houses. As soon as her son, Clotaire, was of an age, Queen Bathildes withdrew from the world and entered the convent of Chelles. There, she seemed entirely to forget her worldly dignity, and was distinguished from the rest of the community only by her humility, obedience to spiritual superiors, and her devotion to the sick, whom she comforted and served with wonderful charity. As Queen Bathildes neared her end, God visited her with a severe illness, which she bore with Christian patience until, on the 30th of January 680, she yielded up her soul with prayer.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Columba Marmion((1858-1923))</h3><hr /><p>Bl. Columba Marmion Third Abbot of Maredsous (1858-1923) Bl. Columba Marmion was born in Dublin, Ireland, on April 1, 1858 to an Irish father (William Marmion) and a French mother (Herminie Cordier). Given the name Joseph Aloysius at birth, he entered the Dublin diocesan seminary in 1874 and completed his theological studies at the College of the Propagation of the Faith in Rome. He was ordained a priest at St. Agatha of the Goths on June 16, 1881. Fr. Columba dreamed of becoming a missionary monk in Australia, but was won over by the liturgical atmosphere of the newly founded Abbey of Maredsous in Belgium, which he visited on his return to Ireland in 1881. His Bishop asked him to wait and appointed him curate in Dundrum, then professor at the major seminary in Clonliffe (1882-86). As the chaplain at a convent of Redemptorist nuns and at a women's prison, he learned to guide souls, to hear confessions, to counsel and to help the dying. In 1886, he received his Bishop's permission to become a monk. He voluntarily renounced a promising ecclesiastical career and was welcomed at Maredsous by Abbot Placidus Wolter. His novitiate, under the iron rule of Dom Benoît D'Hondt and among a group of young novices (when he was almost 30), proved all the more difficult because he had to change habits, culture and language. But saying that he had entered the monastery to learn obedience, he let himself be moulded by monastic discipline, community life and choral prayer until his solemn profession on February 10, 1891. Fr. Columba received his first \"obedience\" or mission when he was assigned to the small group of monks sent to found the Abbey of Mont César in Louvain. Although it distressed him, he gave his all to it for the sake of obedience. There he was entrusted with the task of Prior beside Abbot de Kerchove, and served as spiritual director and professor to all the young monks studying philosophy or theology in Louvain. He started to devote more time to preaching retreats in Belgium and in the United Kingdom, and gave spiritual direction to many communities, particularly those of Carmelite nuns. He become the confessor of Mons. Joseph Mercier, the future Cardinal, and the two formed a lasting friendship. During this period, Maredsous Abbey was governed by Dom Hildebrand de Hemptinne, its second Abbot, who in 1893 would become, at the request of Leo XIII, the first Prelate of the Benedictine Confederation. Hildebrand's frequent stays in Rome required that he be replaced as Abbot of Maredsous. Thus Fr. Columba was elected the third Abbot of Maredsous on September 28, 1909, receiving the abbatial blessing on October 3. Fr. Columba was placed at the head of a community of more than 100 monks, with a humanities college, a trade school and a farm to run. He also had to maintain a well-established reputation for research on the sources of the faith and to continue editing various publications, including the Revue Bénédictine. Fr. Columba's ongoing care of the community did not stop him from preaching retreats or giving regular spiritual direction. He was asked to help the Anglican monks of Caldey when they wished to convert to Catholicism. His greatest ordeal was the First World War. His decision to send the young monks to Ireland so that they could complete their education in peace led to additional work, dangerous trips and many anxieties. It also caused misunderstandings and conflicts between the two generations within this community shaken by the war. German lay brothers, who had been present since the monastery's foundation by Beuron Abbey, had to be sent home (despite the Benedictine vow of stability) at the outbreak of hostilities. After the war was over, a small group of monks was urgently dispatched to the Monastery of the Dormition in Jerusalem to replace the German monks expelled by the British authorities. Finally, the Belgian monasteries were separated from the Beuron Congregation, and in 1920 the Belgian Congregation of the Annunciation was set up with Maredsous, Mont César and St. André of Zevenkerken. Fr. Columba's sole comfort during this period was preaching and giving spiritual direction. His secretary, Dom Raymond Thibaut, prepared his spiritual conferences for publication: Christ the Life of the Soul (1917), Christ in His Mysteries (1919) and Christ the Ideal of the Monk (1922). He was already considered an outstanding Abbot (Queen Elisabeth of Belgium consulted with him at length) and a great spiritual author. Bl. Columba Marmion died during a flu epidemic on January 30, 1923. He was beatified by John Paul II on the 3rd of September 2000.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hyacinthe Mariscotti()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Let us take flight, or none of us will escape from Absalom. Leave quickly, lest he hurry and overtake us, then visit disaster upon us and put the city to the sword.\"<br />As David went up the Mount of Olives, he wept without ceasing. His head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. All those who were with him also had their heads covered and were weeping as they went.<br />As David was approaching Bahurim, a man named Shimei, the son of Gera of the same clan as Saul's family, was coming out of the place, cursing as he came.<br />He threw stones at David and at all the king's officers, even though all the soldiers, including the royal guard, were on David's right and on his left.<br />Shimei was saying as he cursed: \"Away, away, you murderous and wicked man!<br />The LORD has requited you for all the bloodshed in the family of Saul, in whose stead you became king, and the LORD has given over the kingdom to your son Absalom. And now you suffer ruin because you are a murderer.\"<br />Abishai, son of Zeruiah, said to the king: \"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, please, and lop off his head.\"<br />But the king replied: \"What business is it of mine or of yours, sons of Zeruiah, that he curses? Suppose the LORD has told him to curse David; who then will dare to say, 'Why are you doing this?'\"<br />Then the king said to Abishai and to all his servants: \"If my own son, who came forth from my loins, is seeking my life, how much more might this Benjaminite do so! Let him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.<br />Perhaps the LORD will look upon my affliction and make it up to me with benefits for the curses he is uttering this day.\"<br />David and his men continued on the road, while Shimei kept abreast of them on the hillside, all the while cursing and throwing stones and dirt as he went.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>3,2-3.4-5.6-7.</em><p>O LORD, how many are my adversaries!<br />Many rise up against me!<br />Many are saying of me,<br />?There is no salvation for him in God.?<br />But you, O LORD, are my shield;<br />my glory, you lift up my head!<br />When I call out to the LORD,<br />he answers me from his holy mountain.<br />When I lie down in sleep,<br />I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.<br />I fear not the myriads of people<br />arrayed against me on every side.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>5,1-20.</em><p>Jesus and his disciples came to the other side of the sea, to the territory of the Gerasenes.<br />When he got out of the boat, at once a man from the tombs who had an unclean spirit met him.<br />The man had been dwelling among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, even with a chain.<br />In fact, he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains, but the chains had been pulled apart by him and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.<br />Night and day among the tombs and on the hillsides he was always crying out and bruising himself with stones.<br />Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran up and prostrated himself before him,<br />crying out in a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me!\"<br />(He had been saying to him, \"Unclean spirit, come out of the man!\")<br />He asked him, \"What is your name?\" He replied, \"Legion is my name. There are many of us.\"<br />And he pleaded earnestly with him not to drive them away from that territory.<br />Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.<br />And they pleaded with him, \"Send us into the swine. Let us enter them.\"<br />And he let them, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine. The herd of about two thousand rushed down a steep bank into the sea, where they were drowned.<br />The swineherds ran away and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside. And people came out to see what had happened.<br />As they approached Jesus, they caught sight of the man who had been possessed by Legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. And they were seized with fear.<br />Those who witnessed the incident explained to them what had happened to the possessed man and to the swine.<br />Then they began to beg him to leave their district.<br />As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed pleaded to remain with him.<br />But he would not permit him but told him instead, \"Go home to your family and announce to them all that the Lord in his pity has done for you.\"<br />Then the man went off and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him; and all were amazed.</p><hr /><h3>St. John Bosco(Priest (1815-1888) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINT JOHN BOSCO Priest (1815-1888) Born in the diocese of Turin in 1815, and brought up in poverty, John Bosco devoted his life to the education of working youth. He founded religious congregations: the Salesian Order and the Congregation of the Helpers of Mary. St. John Bosco's mystical experiences were only known after his death. Like Jesus, he never paraded his gifts. He passed away on January 30, 1888 at the age of seventy-two.</p><hr /><h3>St. Marcella(Widow (325-410))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARCELLA Widow (325-410) St. Marcella, whom St. Jerome called the glory of Roman women, was widowed after only seven months of marriage. By grace, she grew determined to consecrate the remainder of her days to the service of God. She rejected the hand of Cerealis, the consul, uncle of Gallus Caesar, and resolved to imitate the lives of the Eastern ascetics. She abstained from wine and meat, employed all her time in pious reading and prayer, and visited churches; never speaking with any man alone. Her example was followed by women who placed themselves under her direction. When the Goths under Alaric plundered Rome in 410, St. Marcella was scourged to make her divulge the location of treasures. Long before, she had distributed them in charitable giving. St. Marcella trembled only for the innocence of her dear spiritual daughter, Principia. By St. Marcella's wisdom and God's grace, the Goths spared Principia; and conducted the Saint and her pupil to the Church of St. Paul, to which Alaric had granted the right of sanctuary, along with that of St. Peter. St. Marcella lived a only a little while longer, passing away in St. Principia's arms at the end of August, 410.</p>"
