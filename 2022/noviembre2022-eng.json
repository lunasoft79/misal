They stood before the throne and before the Lamb, wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands.<br />They cried out in a loud voice: \"Salvation comes from our God, who is seated on the throne, and from the Lamb.\"<br />All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They prostrated themselves before the throne, worshiped God,<br />and exclaimed: \"Amen. Blessing and glory, wisdom and thanksgiving, honor, power, and might be to our God forever and ever. Amen.\"<br />Then one of the elders spoke up and said to me, \"Who are these wearing white robes, and where did they come from?\"<br />I said to him, \"My lord, you are the one who knows.\" He said to me, \"These are the ones who have survived the time of great distress; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>24(23),1-2.3-4ab.5-6.</em><p>The LORD's are the earth and its fullness; <br />the world and those who dwell in it.<br />For he founded it upon the seas <br />and established it upon the rivers.<br />Who can ascend the mountain of the LORD? <br />or who may stand in his holy place?<br />One whose hands are sinless, whose heart is clean,<br />who desires not what is vain.<br />He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, <br />a reward from God his savior.<br />Such is the race that seeks for him, <br />that seeks the face of the God of Jacob.</p><h3>First Letter of John</h3><em>3,1-3.</em><p>Beloved: See what love the Father has bestowed on us that we may be called the children of God.

Although they were poor, they were animated by the Holy Spirit. Martin used his brilliant mind to learn medicine; and was so successful that he received apprenticeship to a surgeon. Martin was also pious: praying regularly and receiving Jesus, the Eternal Priest, in the sacraments (Heb. 4:14). When he was 15, Martin sought admission to the Dominican order, but was only received as a servant because of his native heritage. To live his vocation, St. Martin performed menial labor and begged to provide his Order with food. St. Martin himself never ate meat, and only charity sustained him through endless acts of penance. He developed character by relying on the will of God; embracing the many crosses out of love. St. Martin's superiors broke with social norms when they gave him St. Dominic's habit. His fidelity and patience already tinging on heroism: his superiors placed him in charge of the infirmary, where he ministered to slaves and nobles alike. He worked cheerfully while performing his duties no matter how difficult. Like St. Mother Teresa, Martin served Christ in the suffering. \"Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me\" (Mt. 25:40). St. Martin passed away at 59 on November 3. The miracles proceeding from his intercession were recognized, but it would be one hundred years when he was canonized. He is our intercessor, friend, and model of Christian heroism and manhood.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hubert(Bishop (657-727))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT HUBERT Bishop(657-727) St. Hubert's early life is so obscured by popular traditions that we have no historical account of his actions. He is said to have been addicted to hunting, and given himself to worldly pursuits. One thing is certain: he is the patron of hunters. Moved by divine grace, Hubert renounced the world, vainglory and every human error to seek God. His extraordinary fervor and progress in virtue recommended him to St. Lambert, Bishop of Maestricht, who ordained him a priest. Hubert was afterward entrusted with a principal share in the administration of the diocese. That holy prelate being murdered in 681, Fr. Hubert was unanimously elected his successor. With incredible zeal, Bp. Hubert penetrated into the most remote and tribal places of Ardenne. He abolished the worship of idols and introduced mercy in place of sacrifice (Mt. 9:13). While Bp. Hubert evangelized, God bestowed upon him the gift of miracles. Bp. Hubert passed away at 70 while reciting the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. A faithful shepherd to the end, God welcomed him to Paradise. He was canonized for his heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from his intercession.</p><hr /><h3>St. Winifred()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Prepare a full account of your stewardship, because you can no longer be my steward.'<br />The steward said to himself, 'What shall I do, now that my master is taking the position of steward away from me? I am not strong enough to dig and I am ashamed to beg.<br />I know what I shall do so that, when I am removed from the stewardship, they may welcome me into their homes.'<br />He called in his master's debtors one by one. To the first he said, 'How much do you owe my master?'<br />He replied, 'One hundred measures of olive oil.' He said to him, 'Here is your promissory note. Sit down and quickly write one for fifty.'<br />Then to another he said, 'And you, how much do you owe?' He replied, 'One hundred kors of wheat.' He said to him, 'Here is your promissory note; write one for eighty.'<br />And the master commended that dishonest steward for acting prudently. \"For the children of this world are more prudent in dealing with their own generation than are the children of light.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Charles Borromeo(Archbishop of Milan († 1584))</h3><p>SAINT CHARLES BORROMEOArchbishop of Milan(1538-1584) About fifty years after the Protestant heresy broke out, our Lord raised up a youth to renew the face of His Church. In 1560, Charles Borromeo, then 22, was elected cardinal, and by the side of his uncle, Pius IV, administered the Holy See. His first care was the direction of the Council of Trent. He urged its sessions forward, guided it with correspondence from Rome, and carried it to its conclusion. Then he began a more arduous work: the execution of its decrees. As Archbishop of Milan, St. Charles enforced the reforms of the Council of Trent and restored the discipline of his see. He founded schools for the poor, seminaries for clerics, and trained his priests to perfection. Inflexible in maintaining clerical discipline, he was a tender father to his flock. He would sit by the roadside to teach a poor man the Pater and the Ave; and would enter dirty hovels to bring the light and the sacraments of Christ. During the great plague, he stayed in Milan to minister to the sick and dying. He even sold his bed to support the work. He passed away a faithful servant, following the Good Shepherd to paradise (Mt. 25:23).</p><hr /><h3>St. Felix of Valois(Co-founder of the Trinitarians (1127-1212))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT FELIX OF VALOIS Hermit and co-founder of the Trinitarians (1127-1212) St. Felix was a son of the Count of Valois. He was blessed that his mother cultivated his faith and spirit. The unjust divorce of his parents matured his resolution to begin life as a religious. Entrusting his mother's care to her pious brother, Thibault, Count of Champagne, St. Felix took the Cistercian habit at Clairvaux. St. Felix's holiness was evident, but his particular calling was still taking shape. With St. Bernard's consent, he departed for Italy and led an austere life with an aged hermit. When St. Felix's spiritual director passed away, he returned to France, and for many years lived as a solitary at Cerfroid. Here, God inspired him to found an order for the redemption of Christian captives. St. John of Matha, moved by a similar impulse, joined St. Felix; and together they enshrined the rules of the Order of the Holy Trinity. When disciples rallied under their banner, Sts. Felix and John made a pilgrimage to Rome and obtained Pope Innocent III's permission for a new order. Their order, the Trinitarians, was committed to ransoming Christians enslaved by Islamic armies. With prayers granted, St. Felix spent the next fifteen years organizing and developing his foundations. St. Felix passed away in 1212. He continues receiving prayers for intercession and guiding the Trinitarians. Concerned with the good of souls, we must renew the image of Christ in others without heed to vainglory or human respect; reverently entrusting our endeavors to Mary, the Mother of God.</p>"

Emulating her family's virtues, she shunned worldly vanity and avoided near occasions of sin. She longed for the consecrated life, but did not tell her parents. She first consulted St. Ouen, who encouraged her and helped her resolution. When St. Bertilla announced her desire to profess vows, her parents did not oppose it. Rather, they encouraged her. They helped her move to Jouarre, a great monastery in Brie, four leagues from Meaux, where she was received with great joy and trained in monastic perfection. By her humility toward her sisters, St. Bertilla seemed every one's servant; and acquitted herself with such great charity that she was chosen prioress to assist the abbess. Around the year 646, she was appointed as the first abbess of the abbey of Chelles. She administered the abbey with heroic virtue for forty-six years.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sylvia()</h3><hr />"

Put on your apron and wait on me while I eat and drink. You may eat and drink when I am finished'?<br />Is he grateful to that servant because he did what was commanded?<br />So should it be with you. When you have done all you have been commanded, say, 'We are unprofitable servants; we have done what we were obliged to do.'\"</p><hr /><h3>Saint Elizabeth of the Trinity()</h3><p>St. Elizabeth of the TrinityCarmelite Religious St. Elizabeth of the Trinity, O.C.D., was a French Discalced Carmelite in addition to being a mystic and spiritual writer. Her spiritual mastery came by way of the Carmelite vocation. Like St. Mother Teresa, she too experienced spiritual dryness and desolation. St. Elizabeth's devotion to the charism of the Carmelites proved dear to the Heart of Jesus Christ, who blessed her with spiritual liberation and ultimate graces. St. Elizabeth was born on July 18, 1880, as Élisabeth Catez, in the military base at Avord in Cher, France. She was the first child of Captain Joseph Catez and Marie Rolland. Her father passed away unexpectedly on October 2, 1887, and the family moved to Dijon as a result. St. Elizabeth's affections for the Carmelite vocation were shared in her letters. \"I can't find words to express my happiness\" she wrote. \"Here there is no longer anything but God. He is All; He suffices and we live by Him alone\" (Letter 91). St. Elizabeth passed away at 26 from Addison's disease, which was uncurable in the early twentieth century. She gratefully accepted the pain as if it were a gift. Her last words were, \"I am going to Light, to Love, to Life!\" At the end of her life, St. Elizabeth began calling herself Laudem Gloriae, which means, \"praise of glory.\" She said: \"I think that in Heaven my mission will be to draw souls by helping them to go out of themselves in order to cling to God by a wholly simple and loving movement, and to keep them in this great silence within, which will allow God to communicate Himself to them and to transform them into Himsef.\" \"I love to penetrate beyond the veil of the soul to this inner sanctuary where we live alone with God. He wants us entirely to himself, and is making there within us a cherished solitude. Listen to everything that is being sung ... in his heart. It is Love, the infinite love that envelops us and desires to give us a share ... in all His blessedness. The whole Blessed Trinity Dwells in us, the whole of that mystery which will be our vision in heaven. I am 'Elizabeth of the Trinity' - Elizabeth disappearing, losing herself, allowing herself to be invaded by the Three ... All day long let us surrender ourselves to Love, by doing the will of God, under his gaze, with him, in him, for him alone. ... And then, when evening comes, after a dialogue of love that has never stopped in our hearts, let us go to sleep still in love.\"</p><hr /><h3>Bl. John Duns Scotus(O.F.M. (c.1266-1308))</h3><hr /><p>Blessed John Duns Scotus Franciscan Theologian (c. 1266 - 1308) Blessed John (Johannes) Duns Scotus was an influential theologian and philosopher during the High Middle Ages. Born at Duns in the county of Berwick, Scotland, around 1266, John descended from a wealthy farming family. He received the habit of the Friars Minor at Dumfries, where his uncle, Elias Duns, was superior. After a novitiate, he studied at Oxford and Paris, and was ordained to the priesthood on March 17, 1291. He was nicknamed Doctor Subtilis (the \"Subtle Doctor\") for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought and was remembered for defending the doctrine of Immaculate Conception. During the night of Christmas, 1299, at the Oxford Convent, Bl. John, immersed in his contemplation of the adorable mystery of the Incarnation of the Word, was rapt in ecstasy. The Blessed Mother appeared to him and placed in his arms the Child Jesus, who kissed and embraced him. Bl. John Duns Scotus passed away in 1308 and is buried in the Franciscan church near the famous Cologne cathedral. His work helped solemnly define the Immaculate Conception of Mary in 1854. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Basilica on March 20, 1993.</p><hr /><h3>St. Godfrey(Bishop (1066-1115))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GODFREY Bishop (1066-1115) St. Godfrey was born in the diocese of Soissons; and was ordained a priest at 25. Later, he became abbot of the Abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy. In 1104, Fr. Godfrey was appointed bishop of Amiens. To discipline his mind, he mortified his senses through fasting. He rejected self-gratification, enforced clerical celibacy and opposed drunkenness and simony. For most of his time as bishop, Godfrey wished to resign and retire as a Carthusian monk. In 1114, he moved to a monastery, but was recalled a few months later by the people of Amiens. He also took part in the Council of Chálons. In 1115, Bp. Godfrey fell sick and took refuge in the abbey of Saint Crépin at Soissons. He passed away peacefully like St. Joseph in the presence of Jesus Christ and Mama Mary.</p>"

But each one must be careful how he builds upon it,<br />for no one can lay a foundation other than the one that is there, namely, Jesus Christ.<br />Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br />If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy that person; for the temple of God, which you are, is holy.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>2,13-22.</em><p>Since the Passover of the Jews was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.<br />He found in the temple area those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, as well as the money-changers seated there.<br />He made a whip out of cords and drove them all out of the temple area, with the sheep and oxen, and spilled the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables,<br />and to those who sold doves he said, \"Take these out of here, and stop making my Father's house a marketplace.\"<br />His disciples recalled the words of scripture, \"Zeal for your house will consume me.\"<br />At this the Jews answered and said to him, \"What sign can you show us for doing this?\"<br />Jesus answered and said to them, \"Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.\"<br />The Jews said, \"This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and you will raise it up in three days?\"<br />But he was speaking about the temple of his body.<br />Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they came to believe the scripture and the word Jesus had spoken.</p><hr /><h3>St. Theodore Tyro(Martyr († c. 306))</h3><p>SAINT THEODORE TYRO Martyr ( c. 306) Early in 306, the emperor comanded all Christians to offer pagan sacrifice. Theodore had just joined the legion; and after marching into Pontus was forced to choose between apostasy or death. He chose death rather than renounce Jesus Christ. To conquer Theodore by gentleness, the commander left him in peace, but Theodore used his freedom to torch the great temple of Isis. After a final attempt, the judge ordered him to apostate. Theodore made the sign of the cross and said, \"Jesus Christ is God.\" After torturing Theodore, the judge goaded him to feeling shame, but Theodore overcame his trials and persevered. For Theodore, the indignity of the Cross was victory over sin and death. By some accounts, while Theodore was being burned to death, a Christian saw his soul rise like a flash of lightning to heaven. Without a doubt, Theodore lives alongside Jesus and the saints forever.</p>"

For behold, the kingdom of God is among you.\"<br />Then he said to his disciples, \"The days will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.<br />There will be those who will say to you, 'Look, there he is,' (or) 'Look, here he is.' Do not go off, do not run in pursuit.<br />For just as lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be (in his day).<br />But first he must suffer greatly and be rejected by this generation.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Leo the Great(Pope and Doctor of the Church († 461) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINT LEO THE GREATPope and Doctor of the Church(461) St. Leo was born in Rome. He was appointed archdeacon of the Roman Church by St. Celestine and administered together with Pope Sixtus III. When Pope Sixtus passed away, Leo was elected Pope. The ceremony took place on St. Michael's day, 440, amid great joy. At the time, Vandals and Huns were invading the provinces of the empire, and Nestorians, Pelagians and other heretics wreaked havoc upon souls. Pope Leo guided the Church through these perils as the heresy of Eutyches erupted: the latter claiming that Jesus had one unique nature instead of being God and man. Pope Leo responded with the true doctrine of the Incarnation, but the heresy gained a footing among Eastern monks and bishops through the Byzantine court. After three years of toil, Pope Leo brought about the heresy's solemn condemnation at the Council of Chalcedon, the Fathers all signing his tome and exclaiming, \"Peter hath spoken by Leo.\" Soon after, Attila and his Huns broke into Italy and marched through its burning cities toward Rome. Pope Leo went out to meet him and prevailed upon him to turn back. Astonished to see the terrible Attila, the Scourge of God, fresh from the sack of Aquileia, Milan and Pavia, with the rich prize of Rome in his grasp, turn back to the Danube, Attila's chiefs asked why he acted so strangely. Attila replied that he saw two venerable personages, supposedly Sts. Peter and Paul, standing beside Pope Leo. St. Peter's solicitude is as great today as when St. Leo walked the earth. When Rome fell prey to the Vandals two years later, Pope Leo again saved it from destruction. He passed away in 461 after leading the Church for twenty years.</p><hr /><h3>St. Andrew Avellino(Priest (1561-1608))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ANDREW AVELLINO Priest (1521-1608) After a holy youth, Lancelot Avellino was ordained a priest at Naples. When he was 36, he entered the Theatine Order and took the name Andrew to show his love for the cross. For fifty years, Fr. Andrew was afflicted with a painful rupture, yet he never used a carriage. Once, when he was carrying the Viaticum, and a storm had extinguished the lamps, a heavenly light encircled him, guided his steps and sheltered him from the rain. But as a rule, his sufferings were unrelieved. On his last day, Fr. Andrew rose to say Mass. He was 89, and so weak that he could barely reach the altar. He began the Judica and fell forward in a fit of apoplexy. Laid on a straw mattress, his whole frame was convulsed in agony while Satan approached him in visible form. Then, as his brethren prayed, the voice of Mary was heard bidding the Saint's guardian angel send the tempter back to hell. A calm and holy smile settled on Fr. Andrew; and with a grateful salutation to the image of Mary, he passed away. Jesus brought Fr. Andrew's soul to Paradise, where he joined the Church Triumphant, on November 10, 1608.</p>"

One winter's day, when stationed at Amiens, he met a beggar almost naked and frozen with cold. Having no money, he cut his cloak in two and gave him the half. That night he saw our Lord clothed in the half cloak, and heard Him say to the angels: \"Martin, yet a catechumen, hath wrapped Me in this garment.\" This made Martin receive baptism and later leave the army. Martin succeeded in converting his mother, but being driven from his home by the Arians, he took shelter with St. Hilary. Together, they founded the first monastery in France near Poitiers. In 372, Martin was made Bishop of Tours. His flock, though Christian in name, was unconverted at heart. Unarmed and attended only by his monks, Bp. Martin destroyed the pagan temples and groves, and completed by his preaching and miracles the conversion of the people. St. Martin is thus known as the Apostle of Gaul. Bp. Martin's last eleven years were spent in humble toil. The purity of his soul was manifested by God through many miracles.</p>"

He embarked on a thoroughgoing pastoral reform: visiting his clergy, seeing that the people were instructed and stoking interest in the liturgy. Bp. Josaphat's reforms scandalized some men, and his life was imperiled. During a pastoral visit to Vitebsk in 1623, he was murdered.

Early in life, she began her journey as a disciple of the Lord, who led her to the heights of sanctity in mysterious and unforeseen ways. The turning point in her life was entering the House of Providence in Codogno, where tribulations and difficulties strengthened her missionary fervor and her resolve to dedicate herself to the Lord. She received the religious habit; and while keeping the name Frances, later added Xavier to it in memory of the great Jesuit missionary and patron of the missions. Thanks to the encouragement and support of Bp. Domenico Maria Gelmini of Lodi, Sr Frances Xavier left the House of Providence with seven companions and founded an institution in an old Franciscan monastery. First called the Salesian Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, they received diocesan approval in 1881. Mother Cabrini asked her sisters for evangelical obedience, mortification, renunciation, vigilance of the heart and interior silence as necessary virtues for conforming their lives to Christ and for fostering and living their missionary desires. Vocations surprisingly blossomed and the institute rapidly expanded in Lombardy and beyond the region, with the opening of the first house in Rome and papal approval of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on 12 March 1888, scarcely eight years after their foundation. Pope Leo XIII asked Mother Cabrini to care for poor Italian immigrants. She longed to go to China, but the Pope's words, \"Not to the East, but to the West\" gave new energy and direction to her missionary zeal. The invitation of Christ's Vicar directed her towards the masses of immigrants who, at the end of the 1800s, were crossing the ocean in large numbers to the United States, often in conditions of extreme poverty. From that moment on, Mother Cabrini's tireless apostolic work was more and more inspired by her desire to bring salvation to all. She used to say, \"The Heart of Jesus does things in such a hurry that I can barely keep up with Him.\" With a group of sisters, she left for New York on the first of many voyages in which, as a messenger of hope, she would achieve ever new goals in her tireless apostolate: Nicaragua, Brazil and Argentina, in addition to France, Spain and England. Armed with remarkable boldness, she started schools, hospitals and orphanages from nothing for the masses of the poor who ventured into the new world in search of work. Not knowing the language and lacking the wherewithal to find a respectable place in American society, they were often victims of the unscrupulous. Her motherly heart, which gave her no peace, reached out to them everywhere: in hovels, prisons and mines. Never intimidated by toil or distance, Mother Cabrini traveled from New York to New Jersey, from Pennsylvania to Illinois, from California to Louisiana and Colorado. Even today, in the United States, where she is still called Mother Cabrini, there is a surprisingly deep devotion to someone who, while loving her country of origin, wanted to obtain American citizenship. She was beatified by Pope Pius XI in 1938, just twenty-one years after her death in Chicago on 22 December 1917. In 1946, she was canonized by Pope Pius XII. In the Holy Year of 1950, he proclaimed her the patroness of immigrants for defending the dignity of those forced to live far from their country, becoming an indomitable peacemaker.(Message of Pope John Paul II to the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart on 150th anniversary of Mother Cabrini's birth)</p><hr /><h3>St. Agostina Livia Pietrantoni((1864-1894))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Agostina Livia Pietrantoni (1864-1894) Virgin Congregation of the Sisters of the Charity of Saint Jeanne-Antide Thouret Once there was, and still is, but with a new face now, a village named Pozzaglia in the Sabina hills. There, in a blessed house, a cosy little nest filled with childrens' voices, lived Olivia: who later was called Livia and took the name Agostina in religious life. Her life, although short, was remarkable; and inspired Pope Paul VI to call her \"simple, transparent, pure, loving...\" She was born and baptized on March 27, 1864, in the little village of Pozzaglia Sabina, at an altitude of 800 meters, in a beautiful area bordered by Rieti, Orvinio and Tivoli. She was the second of eleven children. Her parents, Francesco Pietrantoni and Caterina Costantini, were farmers and worked their small plot of land along with a few added plots that they leased. Livia's childhood and youth were imbued with the values of an honest, hard-working and religious family, in a blessed house where \"all were careful to do good and where they often prayed.\" This period was marked especially by the wisdom of Uncle Domenico. Around 1876, Livia received her first Holy Communion with extraordinary awareness of God's substance and presence in the Eucharist. Very early on, in her large family, where everyone seemed to be a beneficiary to her time and help, she learned from her mother, Caterina, the thoughtfulness and maternal gestures which she showed with such gentleness towards her many younger brothers and sisters. She worked in the fields and looked after the animals before games or school, but benefited from self-discipline to the point of earning the title of \"teacher\" from her classmates.Work and pride At the age of 7, along with other children, she began to work transporting sacks of stone and sand by the thousands for the road from Orvinio to Poggio Moiano. At the age of 12, she left with other young seasonal workers to harvest olives in Tivoli. Precociously wise, she took on the moral and religious responsibility for her young companions. She supported them in this tough work far from their families, and proudly and courageously stood up to arrogant and unscrupulous bosses.Vocation and detachment Livia's wisdom, respect for others, generosity and beauty moved her mother to find a suitable match. However, Livia chose to profess vows instead of marry, much to her mother's angst. To those in the village who attempted to dissuade her, she replied, \"I wish to choose a Congregation in which there is work both day and night.\" Everyone was certain that these words were genuine. A first trip to Rome in the company of her uncle, Fra Matteo, ended in bitter disillusionment: they refused to accept her. However, a few months later, the Mother General of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Jeanne-Antide Thouret told Livia that she was expecting her at the Generalate. Livia understood that this time she was saying farewell forever. With emotion, she took leave of the village people, all the loved corners of her land, her favorite prayer places, the parish and the Virgin of Rifolta. She kissed her parents goodbye, received the blessing of Uncle Domenico, \"kissed the door of her house, traced the sign of the cross on it and left hurriedly...\"Formation and mission Livia was 22 when she arrived in Rome on March 23, 1886, at Via S. Maria in Cosmedin. A few months as a postulant and novice were enough to prove that she had the makings of a Sister of Charity, that is of a \"servant of the poor,\" in the tradition of Saint Vincent de Paul and Saint Jeanne-Antide. Indeed, Livia brought to the Convent a particularly solid spiritual foundation. When she received the religious habit and was given the name of Sister Agostina, she had the premonition that it fell to her to become the saint bearing this name. Sister Agostina was sent to the Hospital of Santo Spirito where 700 years of glorious history had led it to be called \"the school of Christian charity.\" In the wake of the saints who had preceded her, amongst whom were Charles Borromeo, Joseph Casalanz, John Bosco and Camillus de Lellis, Sister Agostina made her personal contribution. In this place where many suffered, she expressed charity to the point of heroism.Silence, prayer and goodness The atmosphere in the hospital was hostile to religion because the Roman question made others doubtful. The Capuchin fathers had been expelled; and the Crucifix and all other religious signs were prohibited. The hospital administrators also wanted to send the sisters away, but were afraid of becoming unpopular. Instead, the sisters' lives were made impossible and they were forbidden to speak about God. Sister Agostina did not need to \"cry out for God,\" but through her life proclaimed the Gospel. First in the childrens' ward and later in the tuberculosis ward, a place of despair and death, where she caught the mortal contagion of which she was miraculously healed, she showed total dedication and an extraordinary concern for each sick person, above all for the most difficult, violent and obscene ones. In secret, in a small hidden corner of the hospital, Sister Agostina commended them all to the Virgin and promised her many more vigils and greater sacrifices in order to obtain the grace of the conversion of the most stubborn ones. How many times she offered Joseph Romanelli to Our Lady! He was vulgar and insolent to Sister Agostina, who was attentive toward him and welcomed his blind mother with great kindness during visits. When, after the umpteenth provocation at the expense of the women working in the laundry, the Director expelled Joseph Romanelli from the hospital, the latter sought a target for his fury; and poor Agostina was the victim. Several times, he sent her death threats scrawled on little notes. Romanelli was not joking in fact, but Sister Agostina put no limits on her generosity to the Lord. She was prepared to pay any price for serving Jesus. When Romanelli caught her unaware, and struck her to death on November 13, 1894, her lips uttered nothing but invocations to the Virgin Mary and words of forgiveness.</p><hr /><h3>St. Stanislaus Kostka (1551-1568)()</h3><hr /><p>SAINT STANISLAUS KOSTKA (1551-1568) St. Stanislaus was from a noble Polish family. At 14, he went with his elder brother Paul to the Jesuits' College at Vienna. Though Stanislaus was ever bright and sweet-tempered, his austerities were felt as a reproach by Paul, who shamefully maltreated him. This ill-usage, and his own penances, brought on a dangerous illness. Being in a Lutheran house, Stanislaus was unable to send for a priest. He remembered that his patroness, St. Barbara, never permitted her devotees to die without the Holy Viaticum. He devoutly appealed to her aid, and she appeared with two angels who gave him the Sacred Host. Stanislaus was cured of illness by our Lady Herself, and was bidden by Her to enter the Society of Jesus. To avoid his father's opposition, he was obliged to depart Vienna. Having proved his constancy by cheerfully performing the most menial offices, he was admitted to the Jesuit novitiate at Rome. There, he lived for ten short months, marked by rare piety, obedience and devotion to the institute. Stanislaus passed away, as he had prayed, on the Feast of the Assumption, 1568, at the age of 17. Jesus brought his soul to heaven because he lost his life for Jesus' sake (Mt. 16:25). We must likewise attain the Beatitudes by practicing the norms of piety, as God never fails.</p>"

When he was 10, his father delivered him as a hostage to Dermod Mac Murchad, King of Leinster. Unfortunately, the king mistreated Lawrence so badly that the father transferred him to the Bishop of Glendalough in the county of Wicklow. The holy youth, with humility in relying upon the will of Jesus instead of his own, received new lights and graces from the Holy Spirit. When the bishop, who was also abbot of the monastery, passed away, Lawrence was made abbot. Just 25 years old, Lawrence governed his community with remarkable virtue and prudence. In 1161, he was unanimously chosen to fill the new metropolitan See of Dublin. About the year 1171, Abp. Lawrence went to Canterbury, England, to see King Henry II about the diocese of Dublin. He was received by the Benedictine monks of Christ Church. The following day, as he walked to the altar, a maniac, led on by the idea of making him another St. Thomas, struck him a violent blow to the head. Everyone present thought that the Archbishop was mortally wounded; but Lawrence came to himself, asked for some water, blessed it, and having his wound washed with it, the blood was immediately stanched; and he celebrated Mass. As with every saint who chose Christ over human respect, Abp. Lawrence had to overcome setbacks and opposition. In response to clerical abuses, he sacked over 150 during his tenure. An authentic pastor, he spent much time in prayer discerning the will of God. In 1175, Henry II of England became offended with Roderic, the monarch of Ireland; so Abp. Lawrence went to negotiate a reconciliation. Henry was so moved by Lawrence's authenticity, charity and prudence that he granted him everything he asked and left the whole matter to his discretion. St. Lawrence journey through time ended on November 14, 1180. He entered eternity and was taken up with Jesus to be with the Church Triumphant forever. His relics are kept in the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Laurent d'Eu, while his heart remains in Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sidonius()</h3><hr />"

He was born at Lauingen on the Danube in Swabia; and carefully educated from boyhood. To pursue higher learning, he left his native land and went to Padua. At the urging of the blessed Jordan, Master General of the Order of Preachers, and against the opposition of his uncle, Albert sought admission to the order of St. Dominic. During his novitiate, he was conspicuous for his piety and strict observance of the rule. Albert loved the Blessed Virgin Mary and prayed Her Rosary. To reach his potential, he completed his studies at Cologne. Afterward, he was successively appointed professor at Hildesheim, Fribourg, Ratisbon and Strasbourg. Albert gained fame as a professor at Paris. Among his beloved pupils was Thomas Aquinas; and he was the first to recognize and acclaim the greatness of that intellect. At Anagni, in the presence of the Supreme Pontiff Alexander IV, Albert refuted William's allegations against the mendicant orders. He was later appointed bishop of Ratisbon. In giving counsel and settling disputes, Bp. Albert carried himself so admirably that he earned the title of peacemaker. He wrote many things on almost every branch of learning, but especially on sacred subjects. He also composed magnificent works about the Sacrament of the Altar. Bp. Albert passed away in the year 1280. He was venerated in many dioceses and by the Order of Preachers. At the request of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, Pope Pius XI gave him the title of doctor; and extended his feast to the universal Church. Pope Pius XII presented him as a patron for students of the natural sciences.</p><hr /><h3>St. Raphael Kalinowski(O.C.D. († 1907))</h3><hr /><p>Raphael Kalinowski O.C.D. (1835-1907) Father Raphael of Saint Joseph Kalinowski was born at Vilna on September 1, 1835. At baptism, he was named Joseph. Under the teaching of his father Andrew in the Institute for Nobles at Vilna, Joseph progressed so much that he received the maximum distinction in studies. He afterward studied in the school of agriculture at Hory-Horky from 1851 to 1852. From 1853 to 1857, Joseph studied in the Academy of Military Engineering at St. Petersburg, obtaining his degree and the rank of lieutenant. Afterward, he was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics at the same academy. In 1859, he took part in designing the Kursk-Kiev-Odessa railway. In 1863, the Polish insurrection broke out against Russia. Joseph resigned from the Russian forces and accepted the post of Minister of War for the region of Vilna in the rebel army. On March 24, 1864, he was arrested and sentenced to death: a penalty that was mitigated to 10 years hard labor in Siberia. With admirable strength of spirit and patient love for his fellow exiles, Joseph instilled into them the spirit of prayer, serenity and hope, and gave material help and encouragement. Repatriated in 1874, he accepted the post of tutor to the Venerable Servant of God, Augusto Czartoryski, living mostly in Paris. His influence on the young prince was such that Augusto discovered his true vocation as priest and religious. He was received into the Salesians by their founder, Saint John Bosco, in 1887. On the other hand, Joseph Kalinowski entered the Discalced Carmelites at Graz in Austria, and received the religious name Brother Raphael of Saint Joseph. He studied theology in Hungary and was ordained a priest at Czerna, near Krakow, on January 15, 1882. Ablaze with apostolic zeal, Fr. Raphael did not spare himself in helping the faithful. He likewise assisted his Carmelite brothers and sisters in the ascent of the mountain of perfection. In the sacrament of Reconciliation, he lifted up many from the mire of sin. He did his utmost to reunify the Church, and bequeathed this mission to his Carmelite brothers and sisters. His superiors entrusted him with many important offices, which he carried out perfectly until the time of his death. Overcome by fatigue and suffering, but held in great respect by religious and laypersons alike, Fr. Raphael was called by God to Paradise on November 15, 1907. He passed away at Wadowice in the monastery he founded. He was buried in the monastery cemetery at Czerna, near Krakow. During his life, and after death, he enjoyed remarkable fame for sanctity, even on the part of the most noble and illustrious persons, such as the Cardinals Dunajewski, Puzyna, Kakowski and Gotti. The Ordinary Process for his eventual beatification was set in motion in the Curia of Krakow during the years 1934 to 1938. In 1943, the Decree was issued concerning his writings. His cause was introduced in 1952; and from 1953 to 1956, the Apostolic Process was conducted where the Congregation discussed his virtues. Pope John Paul II, on October 11, 1980, promulgated the Decree on the heroicity of his virtues. After the approval of the miraculous healing of the Reverend Mis, the Holy Father beatified Father Raphael Kalinowski at Krakow on June 22, 1983. As the fame of his miracles increased, the Curia of Krakow, in 1989, set in motion the Canonical Process to investigate the extraordinary healing of a young child. The discussions of the doctors, theologians and cardinals were brought to a happy conclusion. On July 10, 1990, the Holy Father John Paul II, approved the miracle for the canonization. In the Consistory of November 26, 1990, Pope John Paul II, together with the Cardinals, decided to canonize Blessed Raphael Kalinowski. They set the ceremony for Sunday, November 17, 1991, presenting St. Raphael Kalinowski as a model and patron of the young and young at heart.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Mary of the Passion (1839-1904)()</h3><hr /><p>Blessed Mary of the Passion Foundress of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary(1839-1904) Born on 21st May 1839 in Nantes, France, into a noble Christian family, Hélène Marie Philippine de Chappotin de Neuville pursued eminent virtue and deep faith during childhood. In April 1856, during a retreat, she first experienced a call from God to a life of total consecration. The unforeseen death of her mother delayed her profession of vows. In December 1860, with the consent of the Bishop of Nantes, she entered the Poor Clares, attracted by St. Francis' simplicity and poverty of spirit. On 23rd January 1861, while still a postulant, she had a profound experience of God who invited her to offer herself as a victim for the Church and the Pope. This experience marked her for life. A short time after, having become seriously ill, she had to leave the monastery. When she was well again, her confessor directed her towards the Society of Marie Reparatrice. She entered in 1864, and on the following 15th August, in Toulouse, she received the religious habit with the name Mary of the Passion. In March 1865, while still a novice, she was sent to India to the Apostolic Vicariate of Madurai and confided to the Society of Jesus. The Reparatrice sisters had the task of forming the sisters of the congregation as well as being involved in other apostolic activities. It was there that she pronounced her temporary vows on 3rd May 1866. Because of her supernatural and natural virtues, Bl. Mary was nominated local superior. In July 1867, she was named provincial superior of the three convents of the Reparatrice. Under her guidance, the works of the apostolate developed, peace in the mission was re-established, and fervour and regularity blossomed in the communities. In 1874, a new house was founded in Ootacamund, in the Vicariate of Coimbatore, entrusted to the Paris Foreign Mission Society. However, in Madurai, the dissensions became exacerbated to such an extent that, in 1876, some religious, among them Mary of the Passion, were driven to leave the Society of Marie Reparatrice. They reunited at Ootacamund under the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Coimbatore, Monsignor Joseph Bardou MEP. In November 1876, Mary of the Passion went to Rome to regularize the situation of the twenty separated sisters. On 6th January 1877, she obtained Pius IX's authorization to found a new Institute, which was to be specifically missionary and was to be called the Missionaries of Mary. On the suggestion of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide, Mary of the Passion opened a novitiate in Saint-Brieuc in France, where numerous vocations emerged. In April 1880 and in June 1882, the Servant of God went to Rome to resolve difficulties threatening the stability and growth of the young Institute. The journey in June 1882 marked an important stage in her life: She was authorized to open a house in Rome and rediscovered the Franciscan direction through providential circumstances. On 4th October 1882, in the Church of the Aracoeli, she was received into the Third Order of Saint Francis; and thus began her friendship with the Servant of God, Fr. Bernardin de Portogruaro, Minister General, who supported her with paternal solicitude during her trials. In March 1883, due to latent opposition, Mary of the Passion was deposed from her office of Superior of the Institute. However, after an inquiry ordered by Leo XIII, her innocence was fully acknowledged. At the Chapter of July 1884, she was re-elected. The Institute of the Missionaries of Mary developed rapidly. On 12th August 1885, both the Laudatory Decree and that of affiliation to the Order of Friars Minor were issued. The Constitutions were approved ad experimentum on 17th July 1890 and definitively on 11th May 1896. Overcoming all obstacles and boundaries, missionaries were sent regularly to the most perilous and distant places. The zeal of the Foundress knew no bounds in responding to the calls of the poor and the abandoned. She was particularly interested in the promotion of women and the social question. With intelligence and discretion, she offered collaboration to the pioneers who were working in these spheres. Her intense activity drew its dynamism from contemplation of the great mysteries of faith. For Mary of the Passion, all led back to the Trinity and unity of God, who is truth communicating itself and seeing itself. It was in union with these mysteries that, in an ecclesial and missionary dimension, she lived her vocation. Jesus in the Eucharist was for her \"The Great Missionary\"; and Holy Mary's motherly care traced out for her the path of unconditional donation to the work of God. Thus Bl. Mary opened her Institute to the horizons of universal mission, accomplished in Francis of Assisi's evangelical spirit of simplicity, poverty and charity. She took great care of the spiritual formation of the religious. In 1900, her Institute received the seal of blood through the martyrdom of seven Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, who were beatified in 1946 and canonised during the Great Jubilee of the year 2000. To be the spiritual mother of these missionaries who had known how to live to the shedding of their blood, the ideal proposed by her, was for Mary of the Passion, both a great sorrow, a great joy and a time of great emotion. Worn out by fatigue from journeying and daily labour, Mary of the Passion, after a brief illness, died peacefully in San Remo on 15th November 1904; leaving more than 2,000 religious and eighty-six houses scattered about the four continents. Her relics are venerated in a private oratory of the General House of the Institute of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary in Rome. In February 1918 at San Remo, the Informative Process was opened for the Cause of Beatification and Canonization. In 1941, the Decree on the writings was promulgated; and during the following years, numerous postulatory letters were addressed to the Holy See from all parts of the world in favour of the Cause of the Servant of God. After the Consultors had voted unanimously in its favour, the Decree for the Introduction of the Cause was published on 19th January 1979 with the approbation of Pope John Paul II. On 28th June 1999, the Pope solemnly promulgated the Decree on the heroicity of the virtues of Mother Mary of the Passion. On 5th March 2002, the healing of a religious suffering from pulmonary and vertebral TBC, Pott's Disease, was recognized as a miracle granted by God through the intercession of the Venerable Mary of the Passion. On 20th October 2002, Mary of the Passion was beatified.</p>"

A throne was there in heaven, and on the throne sat<br />one whose appearance sparkled like jasper and carnelian. Around the throne was a halo as brilliant as an emerald.<br />Surrounding the throne I saw twenty-four other thrones on which twenty-four elders sat, dressed in white garments and with gold crowns on their heads.<br />From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. Seven flaming torches burned in front of the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.<br />In front of the throne was something that resembled a sea of glass like crystal.

You have been faithful in this very small matter; take charge of ten cities.'<br />Then the second came and reported, 'Your gold coin, sir, has earned five more.'<br />And to this servant too he said, 'You, take charge of five cities.'<br />Then the other servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your gold coin; I kept it stored away in a handkerchief,<br />for I was afraid of you, because you are a demanding person; you take up what you did not lay down and you harvest what you did not plant.'<br />He said to him, 'With your own words I shall condemn you, you wicked servant. You knew I was a demanding person, taking up what I did not lay down and harvesting what I did not plant;<br />why did you not put my money in a bank? Then on my return I would have collected it with interest.'<br />And to those standing by he said, 'Take the gold coin from him and give it to the servant who has ten.'<br />But they said to him, 'Sir, he has ten gold coins.'<br />'I tell you, to everyone who has, more will be given, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.<br />Now as for those enemies of mine who did not want me as their king, bring them here and slay them before me.'\"<br />After he had said this, he proceeded on his journey up to Jerusalem.</p><hr /><h3>St. Margaret of Scotland (c. 1046-1093)()</h3><p>SAINT MARGARET OF SCOTLANDQueen of ScotlandFoundress of abbeys( 1093) Saint Margaret's name signifies \"pearl\"; \"a fitting name,\" says Theodoric, her confessor and first biographer. Her soul was like a precious pearl: a life amidst the luxury of a royal court never dimmed its lustre, or stole it away from Christ. She was the granddaughter of an English king; and in 1070 became the bride of Malcolm and Queen of Scotland. She ruled with wisdom and virtue until passing away in 1093. Nurtured by Christ present in the Sacraments and the liturgy of the Church, St. Margaret worked zealously. She built churches and monasteries, busied herself in making vestments, and could not rest until Divine and moral laws were observed throughout her realm. St. Margaret also made time to converse with God. She ordered her piety with such sweetness and discretion that she won her husband to sanctity. He used to rise with her at night for prayer and loved to kiss the holy books she read, sometimes bringing them back covered in jewels. St. Margaret sanctified her activities, which included the education of her eight children. Bearing the fruits of the Holy Spirit, she was her husband's most trusted counsellor. Together, they labored for the material improvement of the country. On St. Margaret's death-bed, she received news that her husband and eldest son were slain in battle. She recieved this affliction with humility as a penance for sins. After receiving the Holy Viaticum, she repeated the prayer from the Missal, \"O Lord Jesus Christ, who by thy death didst give life to the world, deliver me.\" At the words \"deliver me,\" says her biographer, she took her departure to Christ, the Author of Life (Ac. 3:15). She was declared the Patroness of Scotland in 1673.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gertrude the Great(Abbess († c. 1302))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GERTRUDE Abbess ( c. 1302) St. Gertrude was born in 1256 to a noble Saxon family. Shewas placed in the Benedictine abbey of Rodelsdorf when she was 5 for education. Her brilliant mind was carefully cultivated; so she was able to write Latin with unusual elegance and force. Above all, she was humble, mortified her senses, and was obedient in all monastic observances. Gertrude's life was colored with wonder and mystical experiences. Obediently, she recorded some of her visions where her soul conversed intimately with Jesus and Mary. She was gentle to all, especially to wayward and misguided souls. She was especially devoted to the Saints, to souls in purgatory, and above all to the Passion of Our Lord and to His Sacred Heart. Gertrude ruled her abbey with perfect wisdom and love for forty years. Her life was one of great and almost continual suffering, but she carried her crosses with courage and love. Gertrude's longing for heaven was granted in 1301 or 1302.</p>"

In her infancy, she was betrothed to Louis Landgrave of Thuringia. To ensure dynastic succession, Elizabeth was brought up in her future husband's court. Elizabeth became not only a queen, but also a mother to the poor. She was discontent with receiving daily numbers of poor in her palace, so she built several hospitals to better serve the sick. Truly concerned with every person and committed to works of mercy, Queen Elizabeth would work in the hospitals and dress patients' sores with her own hands. Once, as she was carrying in the folds of her mantle some provisions for the poor, she met her husband returning from the chase. Astonished to see her bending under the weight of her burden, he opened the mantle and found beautiful red and white roses, although it was not the season for flowers. Bidding Elizabeth pursue her missions, he took one of the marvellous roses and kept it all his life. When her husband suddenly passed away, Queen Elizabeth was cruelly driven from her palace and into the streets with her little children: a prey to hunger and cold. She blessed the Cross and exalted the Holy Names through every trial and tribulation; and continued being a mother to the poor. Queen Elizabeth passed away in 1231 at the age of 24. God would not forget her who loved Him till the end; and granted many miracles through her intercession.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gregory Thaumaturgus(Bishop (3rd century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GREGORY THAUMATURGUSBishop(3rd Century) St. Gregory was born in Pontus to virtuous parents. In 231, he studied philosophy under Origen at Palestine, which led him from the pursuit of human wisdom to Christ. Not long after, Gregory was made Bishop of Neo Cæsarea in his own country. As Gregory laid awake one night, an elderly gentleman appeared and pointed to a lady of supernatural beauty, who radiated heavenly light. The man was St. John the Evangelist, and the Blessed Virgin Mary asked him to instruct Gregory. St. John gave Gregory a creed containing the doctrine of the Trinity in its fullness. Gregory set it in writing, directed all his preaching by it, and handed it down to his successors. Mighty in faith, Bishop Gregory exorcised demons, foretold the future and preserved his flock from heresies. At his word, a rock moved from its place, a river changed its course, and a lake dried up. The accounts of his miracles are exceptional; hence his title Thaumaturgus. Thanks to St. Gregory's work through Christ and the Blessed Virgin, the Church was renewed. When he passed from this life to eternity, the Creed preserved his flock from the Arian pest. He passed away in 270 A.D., joining the Church Triumphant in heaven.</p>"

The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people, meanwhile, were seeking to put him to death,<br />but they could find no way to accomplish their purpose because all the people were hanging on his words.</p><hr /><h3>St. Rose Philippine Duchesne(Religious (1769-1852))</h3><p>Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne Religious, of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (1769-1852) Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne was born on August 29, 1769, in Grenoble, France. She was baptized in the Church of St. Louis and named after Rose of Lima and Philip the apostle. She was educated at the Convent of the Visitation of Ste. Marie d'en Haut. Drawn to the contemplative life, she became a novice there when she was 18 years old. During the French Revolution, her community was dispersed and she returned to her family home. She spent her time nursing prisoners and helping others who suffered. After the Concordat of 1801, she tried with some companions to reconstruct the monastery of Ste. Marie, but without success. In 1804, she learned of a new congregation, the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and offered herself and the monastery to the Foundress, Mother Madeleine Sophie Barat. Mother Barat visited Ste. Marie in 1804 and received Rose and several companions as novices in the Society. Even as Sr Rose's desire deepened for the contemplative life, so too her call to the missions became more urgent - a call she had heard since her youth. In a letter she wrote to Mother Barat, she confided her spiritual experience during a night of adoration before the Eucharist on Holy Thursday: \"I spent the entire night in the new World ... carrying the Blessed Sacrament to all parts of the land ... I had all my sacrifices to offer: a mother, sisters, family, my mountain! When you say to me 'now I send you,' I will respond quickly 'I go.\"' She waited, however, another 12 years. In 1818, Sr Rose's dream was realized. She was sent to respond to the bishop of the Louisiana territory who was looking for a congregation of educators to help teach the native and French children. At St. Charles, near St. Louis, Missouri, Sr Rose founded the first house of the Society outside France. It was in a log cabin; and with it came all the austerities of frontier life: extreme cold, hard work and lack of funds. She also had difficulty learning English. Communication at best was slow and news often did not arrive from France. Maintaining a close relationship with the Society was challenging. Despite setbacks, Sr Rose and four other Religious of the Sacred Heart forged ahead. In 1820, she opened the first free school west of the Mississippi. By 1828, she had founded six houses. These schools were for the young women of Missouri and Louisiana. She loved and served them well, but always in her heart she yearned to serve the native peoples. When she was 72 and no longer superior, a school for the Potawatomi was opened at Sugar Creek, Kansas. Though many thought she was too sick to go, the Jesuit head of the mission insisted: \"She must come; she may not be able to do much work, but she will assure success to the mission by praying for us. Her very presence will draw down all manner of heavenly favors on the work.\" She was with the Potawatomi but a year. However, her pioneer courage did not weaken, and her long hours of contemplation impelled the Indians to name her Quah-kah-ka-num-ad, \"Woman-Who-Prays-Always.\" Unfortunately, her health could not sustain the regime of village life. In July 1842, she returned to St. Charles, although her heart never lost its desire for the missions. She wrote, \"I feel the same longing for the Rocky Mountain missions, and any others like them, that I experienced in France when I first begged to come to America...\" St. Rose Philippine Duchesne passed away at St. Charles, Missouri, on November 18, 1852, at the age of 83. The miracles proceeding from her intercession and the proof of her heroic virtues show that she attained eternal life and the beatific vision, which is seeing God face to face in heaven. As Jesus Christ assures us, \"Everyone who has left houses ... or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life\" (Mt. 19:29).</p><hr /><h3>St. Odo of Cluny († 942)()</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ODO OF CLUNY ( 942) On Christmas-eve in 877, a noble of Aquitaine implored Jesus and Mary to grant him a son. His prayer was granted when Odo was born. With gratitude, the father consecrated Odo to the Holy Spirit and Saint Martin. Odo grew wiser and more virtuous as he matured. Although his father wanted to see him among nobles, Odo departed and began a novitiate in St. Martin at Tours. Following a period of discernment, Odo took the habit of St. Benedict at Baume. Later, he was elected abbot of the great abbey at Cluny. The Pope often called upon Odo to act as a peacemaker between warring princes. It was on one of these missions that he fell ill at Rome. At his urgent entreaty, Odo was borne back to Tours in 942, where he passed away at his own St. Martin's.</p>"

On the evening of her wedding-day, with the music of the marriage-hymn ringing, Cecilia renewed the vow by which she had consecrated her virginity to God. She told her husband, Valerian, that an angel of God was with her. When he asked for proof, Cecilia told him that he would see the angel if he was baptized. Listening to his heart and accepting the Lord's invitation, Valerian was baptized by Pope Urban. When he returned home, he saw an angel of the Lord with Cecilia. Valerian's brother, Tibertius, and a soldier, Maximiam, were also baptized. Fate struck them a blow when they were arrested during the Christian persecution. Sealing their faith with blood, the martyrs laid down their lives for Jesus, and were brought by Him to Paradise. When Cecilia was arrested, she was thrown into a hot bath heated to extreme temperature. However, neither the flames nor the suffocation harmed her. Later, an executioner was dispatched and struck her neck three times. To the his amazement, Cecilia remained alive. She stayed awake, talking about God, Jesus Christ and Mama Mary. St. Cecilia's resting place is in Italy. When her remains were transferred centuries afterward, her body was found uncorrupted and emanating a sweet odor. She may be invoked as the defender and patroness of virgins, women and musicians.</p>"

And thus, we can see where the Church's journey begins in history.St Clement, Bishop of Rome during the last years of the first century, was the Successor of Peter after Linus and Anacletus. The most important testimony concerning his life comes from St Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons until 202. He attests that Clement \"had seen the blessed Apostles\", \"had been conversant with them\", and \"might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes\" (Adversus Haer. 3, 3, 3).The authority and prestige of this Bishop of Rome were such that various writings were attributed to him, but the only one that is certainly his is the Letter to the Corinthians. Eusebius of Caesarea, the great \"archivist\" of Christian beginnings, presents it in these terms: \"There is extant an Epistle of this Clement which is acknowledged to be genuine and is of considerable length and of remarkable merit. He wrote it in the name of the Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth, when a sedition had arisen in the latter Church. We know that this Epistle also has been publicly used in a great many Churches both in former times and in our own\" (Hist. Eccl. 3, 16).An almost canonical character was attributed to this Letter. At the beginning of this text - written in Greek - Clement expressed his regret that \"the sudden and successive calamitous events which have happened to ourselves\" (1, 1) had prevented him from intervening sooner. These \"calamitous events\" can be identified with Domitian's persecution: therefore, the Letter must have been written just after the Emperor's death and at the end of the persecution, that is, immediately after the year 96.Clement's intervention - we are still in the first century - was prompted by the serious problems besetting the Church in Corinth: the elders of the community, in fact, had been deposed by some young contestants. The sorrowful event was recalled once again by St Irenaeus who wrote: \"In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren in Corinth, the Church in Rome dispatched a most powerful Letter to the Corinthians exhorting them to peace, renewing their faith and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the Apostles\" (Adv. Haer. 3, 3, 3).Thus, we could say that this Letter was a first exercise of the Roman primacy after St Peter's death. Clement's Letter touches on topics that were dear to St Paul, who had written two important Letters to the Corinthians, in particular the theological dialectic, perennially current, between the indicative of salvation and the imperative of moral commitment.First of all came the joyful proclamation of saving grace. The Lord forewarns us and gives us his forgiveness, gives us his love and the grace to be Christians, his brothers and sisters. It is a proclamation that fills our life with joy and gives certainty to our action: the Lord always forewarns us with his goodness and the Lord's goodness is always greater than all our sins. However, we must commit ourselves in a way that is consistent with the gift received and respond to the proclamation of salvation with a generous and courageous journey of conversion.The Letter's immediate circumstances provided the Bishop of Rome with ample room for an intervention on the Church's identity and mission. If there were abuses in Corinth, Clement observed, the reason should be sought in the weakening of charity and of the other indispensable Christian virtues. He therefore calls the faithful to humility and fraternal love, two truly constitutive virtues of being in the Church: \"Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One\", he warned, \"let us do all those things which pertain to holiness\" (30, 1).\"The Lord (delegated) peculiar services (Baptism, Last Supper, etc.) to the high priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and their own special ministries devolve on the Levites. The layman is bound by the laws that pertain to laymen\" (40, 1-5: it can be noted that here, in this early first-century Letter, the Greek word \"laikós\" appears for the first time in Christian literature, meaning \"a member of the laos\", that is, \"of the People of God\"). ... Each one (in the Church) ... exercises his ministry in accordance with the vocation he has received [Priestly Traditions].The Father sent Jesus Christ, who in turn sent the Apostles. They then sent the first heads of communities and established that they would be succeeded by other worthy men. Everything, therefore, was made \"in an orderly way, according to the will of God\" (42). With these words, St Clement underlined that the Church's structure was sacramental and not political. The action of God who comes to meet us in the liturgy precedes our decisions and our ideas. The Church is above all a gift of God and not something we ourselves created; consequently, this sacramental structure does not only guarantee the common order but also this precedence of God's gift which we all need.Finally, the \"great prayer\" confers a cosmic breath to the previous reasoning. ... The prayer for rulers and governors acquires special importance. Subsequent to the New Testament texts, it is the oldest prayer extant for political institutions. Thus, in the period following their persecution, Christians, well aware that the persecutions would continue, never ceased to pray for the very authorities who had unjustly condemned them. The reason is primarily Christological: it is necessary to pray for one's persecutors as Jesus did on the Cross. But this prayer also contains a teaching that guides the attitude of Christians towards politics and the State down the centuries. In praying for the Authorities, Clement recognized the legitimacy of political institutions in the order established by God; ... and expressed his concern that the Authorities would be docile to God, \"devoutly in peace and meekness exercising the power given them by [God]\" (61, 2).Another sovereignty emerges whose origins and essence are not of this world but of \"the heavens above\": it is that of Truth, which also claims a right to be heard by the State. ... Let us make our own the invocations of the \"great prayer\" in which the Bishop of Rome made himself the voice of the entire world: \"O Lord, make your face to shine upon us for good in peace, that we may be shielded by your mighty hand... through the High Priest and Guardian of our souls, Jesus Christ, through whom be glory and majesty to you both now and from generation to generation, for evermore\" (60-61).BENEDICT XVI General audience (March 7, 2007)</p><hr /><h3>St. Columban(abbot († 615))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT COLUMBAN Abbot( 615) St. Columban was born in Ireland during the seventh century. He discerned a vocation to religious life and nurtured his spirit through leisure reading and theology. After entering the monastic life, Columban went to France and founded several Catholic monasteries. After denouncing the immoral practices of royal and clerical personalities, he was exiled. He afterward went to Italy and founded the monastery of Bobbio. St. Columban passed away in 615. His legacy was reforming clerical organizations and evangelizing distant peoples. The proofs of his heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from his intercession show that he attained the beatific vision: seeing God fully and entirely forever.</p>"

She has become a haunt for demons. She is a cage for every unclean spirit, a cage for every unclean bird, (a cage for every unclean) and disgusting (beast).<br />A mighty angel picked up a stone like a huge millstone and threw it into the sea and said: \"With such force will Babylon the great city be thrown down, and will never be found again.<br />No melodies of harpists and musicians, flutists and trumpeters, will ever be heard in you again. No craftsmen in any trade will ever be found in you again. No sound of the millstone will ever be heard in you again.<br />No light from a lamp will ever be seen in you again. No voices of bride and groom will ever be heard in you again. Because your merchants were the great ones of the world, all nations were led astray by your magic potion.<br />After this I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying: \"Alleluia! Salvation, glory, and might belong to our God,<br />for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her harlotry. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants.\"<br />They said a second time: \"Alleluia! Smoke will rise from her forever and ever.\"<br />Then the angel said to me, \"Write this: Blessed are those who have been called to the wedding feast of the Lamb.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>100(99),2.3.4.5.</em><p>Sing joyfully to the Lord all you lands,<br />serve the LORD with gladness; <br />come before him with joyful song.<br />Know that the LORD is God; <br />he made us, his we are; <br />his people, the flock he tends.<br />Enter his gates with thanksgiving, <br />his courts with praise; <br />give thanks to him; bless his name. <br />The LORD is good: <br />his kindness endures forever, <br />and his faithfulness, to all generations.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>21,20-28.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: “When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, know that its desolation is at hand.<br />Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains. Let those within the city escape from it, and let those in the countryside not enter the city,<br />for these days are the time of punishment when all the scriptures are fulfilled.<br />Woe to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days, for a terrible calamity will come upon the earth and a wrathful judgment upon this people.<br />They will fall by the edge of the sword and be taken as captives to all the Gentiles; and Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.<br />There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on earth nations will be in dismay, perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves.<br />People will die of fright in anticipation of what is coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.<br />And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.<br />But when these signs begin to happen, stand erect and raise your heads because your redemption is at hand.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Andrew Dung-Lac and His Companions(martyrs (1745-1862) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINTS ANDREW DUNG-LAC Priest, AND HIS COMPANIONS (18th and 19th centuries) This feast day celebrates the martyrs who laid down their lives in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, from 1745 to 1862. Many of the martyrs were priests of the Dominican order. Others belonged to the Paris Society for Foreign Missions, while still others, including Andrew Dung-Lac, were Vietnamese. Paul Le-Bao-Tinh, a Vietnamese seminarian, wrote a letter shortly before his martyrdom in 1843: \"I, Paul, chained for the name of Christ, wish to tell you the tribulations in which I am immersed every day, so that you, inflamed with love for God, may also lift up your praise to God, 'for his mercy endures forever'. This prison is truly the image of the eternal Hell: to the cruelest tortures of all types, such as fetters, iron chains and bonds, are added hate, vindictiveness, calumny, indecent words, interrogations, bad acts, unjust oaths, curses and finally difficulties and sorrow. But God, who once freed the three boys from the path of the flames, is always with me and has freed me from these tribulations and converted them into sweetness, 'for his mercy endures forever...'\"Assist me with your prayers so that I may struggle according to the law, and indeed 'fight the good fight' and that I may be worthy to fight until the end, finishing my course happily; if we do not see each other again in this life, in the future age, nonetheless, this will be our joy, when standing before the throne of the spotless Lamb, with one voice we sing his praises, exulting in the joy of eternal victory. Amen.\"</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Flora & Mary()</h3><hr />"

Before her Baptism, it is said that she saw the Blessed Virgin Mary in a vision. In the vision, the Mother of God asked Her Son to receive Catherine among God's servants. After her Baptism, Catherine experienced another vision: this time Jesus welcoming her into the court of heaven. When the tyrant Maximin II came to Alexandria, he was fascinated by Catherine's femininity and wisdom. In vain, he urged a futile pursuit. After some time, he grew frustrated and enraged; and ordered Catherine to be stripped and scourged. When Catherine fled to the Arabian mountains, soldiers overtook her. They tortured her and afterward killed her. Catherine prayed before dying that no man would see or touch her body; hence angels bore it to a holy grave on Mount Sinai.</p>"

He was the first to excommunicate Melitius and Arius, the schismatics. Upholding the Apostles Creed and the Church's Traditions, St. Peter resisted both secular forces and heretical sabotage to guide the Church through this tumultuous period. St. Peter and the bishops before him shielded their flock from persecution: the first recorded civil rights movement in Western History. Founded upon free speech and dialogue, the Church raised up the Western world from the darkness of pagan sacrifice; raising up the dignity of man and woman; and through Jesus' ministry making them worthy of God Himself. After guarding Christians from being murdered, the Pope resisted the efforts of heretics to hijack the Church. Heresy always turns the mood against the mind, says Chesterton. Arius encouraged dissatisfied people to repeat what he had said: to feel validation by pleasing one another. By saying Jesus Christ was just a man and not God, Arius predated the teachings of Islam on the divinity of Jesus by 300-something years. St. Peter was performing his Apostolic duty - carrying out the ministry and Traditions that Jesus taught His Apostles - when he was martyred. Laying down his life for the sake of others, he became like Jesus. By speaking the truth and upholding freedom of speech, St. Peter is not just the rock of the Church, but of Western Civilization (Mt. 16:18,19).</p><hr /><h3>St. Sylvester(Abbot († 1267))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Sylvester Abbot ( 1267) St. Sylvester was from a noble family of Osimo, at Picenum. He was remarkable, even as a boy, for his keen intellect and upright conduct. Being instructed in sacred learning and made a canon, he set the example of regularity in devotions and disinterested love and service toward others. At the funeral of a relative who was also a nobleman, Sylvester saw the open tomb and grasped the reality of sin and death. To better serve the Mystical Body of Christ, Sylvester went into the desert to perfect his spirit. He conformed his will and intellect to the Divine through vigils, prayer and fasting: always giving his body a little less than it asked for (St. Jose Maria Escriva). True tohis vocation as a solitary and mystic, St. Sylvester sometimes changed his dwelling place. At length, he arrived at Monte Fano, a removed place, and built a church in honor of St. Benedict. In doing so, he laid the foundations of the Congregation of Sylvestrines. At his Church in Monte Fano, Sylvester guided the monks through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. He also prophesied and exorcised demons. He passed away in 1267; and joined the Church Triumphant in heaven. St. Sylvester nurtured his faith in order for it to grow. Let us follow his example and accept God's invitation to dialogue and become instruments of His will. \"Through a plan of sheer loving goodness, He (God) created us; to communicate Himself to us and make us sharers in His own blessed life\" (CCC 1).</p><hr /><h3>St. Leonard of Port Maurice()</h3><hr /><p></p>"
