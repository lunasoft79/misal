This is the way we may know that we are in union with him:<br />whoever claims to abide in him ought to live (just) as he lived.<br />Beloved, I am writing no new commandment to you but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.<br />And yet I do write a new commandment to you, which holds true in him and among you, for the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.<br />Whoever says he is in the light, yet hates his brother, is still in the darkness.<br />Whoever loves his brother remains in the light, and there is nothing in him to cause a fall.<br />Whoever hates his brother is in darkness; he walks in darkness and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</p><h3>Psalms - 96(95),1-2a.2b-3.5b-6.</h3><p>Sing to the LORD a new song; <br />sing to the LORD, all you lands.<br />Sing to the LORD; bless his name.<br />Announce his salvation, day after day.<br />Tell his glory among the nations;<br />among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.  <br />The LORD made the heavens.<br />Splendor and majesty go before him; <br />Praise and grandeur are in his sanctuary.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke - 2,22-35.</h3><p>When the days were completed for their purification according to the law of Moses, Mary and Joseph took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,<br />just as it is written in the law of the Lord, \"Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,\"<br />and to offer the sacrifice of \"a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,\" in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.<br />Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the holy Spirit was upon him.<br />It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah of the Lord.<br />He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,<br />he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying:<br />Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word,<br />for my eyes have seen your salvation,<br />which you prepared in sight of all the peoples,<br />a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.\"<br />The child's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him;<br />and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, \"Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted<br />(and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\"</p><h3> - </h3><p></p><hr /><h3>St. Thomas Becket (Bishop and Martyr († 1170))</h3><h3> ()</h3>"
