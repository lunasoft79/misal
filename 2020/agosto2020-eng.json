'for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'\"<br />The prophet Jeremiah answered the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people assembled in the house of the LORD,<br />and said: Amen! thus may the LORD do!

You grew and developed, you came to the age of puberty; your breasts were formed, your hair had grown, but you were still stark naked.<br />Again I passed by you and saw that you were now old enough for love. So I spread the corner of my cloak over you to cover your nakedness; I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you; you became mine, says the Lord GOD.<br />Then I bathed you with water, washed away your blood, and anointed you with oil.<br />I clothed you with an embroidered gown, put sandals of fine leather on your feet; I gave you a fine linen sash and silk robes to wear.<br />I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms, a necklace about your neck,<br />a ring in your nose, pendants in your ears, and a glorious diadem upon your head.<br />Thus you were adorned with gold and silver; your garments were of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. Fine flour, honey, and oil were your food. You were exceedingly beautiful, with the dignity of a queen.<br />You were renowned among the nations for your beauty, perfect as it was, because of my splendor which I had bestowed on you, says the Lord GOD.<br />But you were captivated by your own beauty, you used your renown to make yourself a harlot, and you lavished your harlotry on every passer-by, whose own you became.<br />Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you when you were a girl, and I will set up an everlasting covenant with you.<br />that you may remember and be covered with confusion, and that you may be utterly silenced for shame when I pardon you for all you have done, says the Lord GOD.</div></div><div><h2>Book of Isaiah 12,2-3.4bcd.5-6.</h2><div>God indeed is my savior;<br />I am confident and unafraid.<br />My strength and my courage is the LORD,<br />and he has been my savior.<br /><br />With joy you will draw water<br />at the fountain of salvation.<br />Give thanks to the LORD, acclaim his name;<br />among the nations make known his deeds,<br />proclaim how exalted is his name.<br /><br />Sing praise to the LORD for his glorious achievement;<br />let this be known throughout all the earth.<br />Shout with exultation, O city of Zion,<br />for great in your midst<br />is the Holy One of Israel!</div></div><div><h2>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew 19,3-12.</h2><div>Some Pharisees approached Jesus, and tested him, saying, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?\"<br />He said in reply, \"Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'<br />and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?<br />So they are no longer two, but one flesh.

(And) he went out again around noon, and around three o'clock, and did likewise.<br />Going out about five o'clock, he found others standing around, and said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'<br />They answered, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard.'<br />When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'<br />When those who had started about five o'clock came, each received the usual daily wage.<br />So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, but each of them also got the usual wage.<br />And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner,<br />saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who bore the day's burden and the heat.'<br />He said to one of them in reply, 'My friend, I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?<br />Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you?<br />(Or) am I not free to do as I wish with my own money? Are you envious because I am generous?'<br />Thus, the last will be first, and the first will be last.\"</div></div></div>"

Do not be terrified on account of them, or I will terrify you before them;<br />For I am the one who today makes you a fortified city, a pillar of iron, a wall of bronze, against the whole land: against Judah’s kings and princes, its priests and the people of the land.<br />They will fight against you, but not prevail over you, for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD.</div></div><div><h2>Psalms 71(70),1-2.3-4a.5-6ab.15ab.17.</h2><div>In you, LORD, I take refuge;<br />let me never be put to shame.<br />In your justice rescue and deliver me;<br />incline your ear to me, and save me.<br /><br />Be my rock of refuge,<br />a stronghold to give me safety,<br />for you are my rock and my fortress.<br />O my God, rescue me from the hand of the wicked.<br /><br />For you are my hope, O Lord;<br />my trust, O God, from my youth.<br />On you I depend from birth;<br />from my mother's womb you are my strength.<br /><br />My mouth shall declare your justice,<br />day by day your salvation.<br />O God, you have taught me from my youth,<br />and till the present I proclaim your wondrous deeds.</div></div><div><h2>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark 6,17-29.</h2><div>Herod was the one who had John arrested and bound in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, whom he had married.<br />John had said to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\"<br />Herodias harbored a grudge against him and wanted to kill him but was unable to do so.<br />Herod feared John, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man, and kept him in custody. When he heard him speak he was very much perplexed, yet he liked to listen to him.<br />She had an opportunity one day when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers, his military officers, and the leading men of Galilee.<br />Herodias's own daughter came in and performed a dance that delighted Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, \"Ask of me whatever you wish and I will grant it to you.\"<br />He even swore (many things) to her, \"I will grant you whatever you ask of me, even to half of my kingdom.\"<br />She went out and said to her mother, \"What shall I ask for?\" She replied, \"The head of John the Baptist.\"<br />The girl hurried back to the king's presence and made her request, \"I want you to give me at once on a platter the head of John the Baptist.\"<br />The king was deeply distressed, but because of his oaths and the guests he did not wish to break his word to her.<br />So he promptly dispatched an executioner with orders to bring back his head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison.<br />He brought in the head on a platter and gave it to the girl. The girl in turn gave it to her mother.<br />When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</div></div></div>"

No such thing shall ever happen to you.\"<br />He turned and said to Peter, \"Get behind me, Satan! You are an obstacle to me. You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do.\"<br />Then Jesus said to his disciples, \"Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.<br />For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.<br />What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? Or what can one give in exchange for his life?<br />For the Son of Man will come with his angels in his Father's glory, and then he will repay everyone according to his conduct.\"</div></div></div>"
