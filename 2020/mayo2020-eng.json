for stone, and bitumen for mortar.<br/>Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city<br/>and a tower with its top in the sky,<br/>and so make a name for ourselves;<br/>otherwise we shall be scattered all over the earth.”</p><p>The LORD came down to see the city and the tower<br/>that the people had built.<br/>Then the LORD said: “If now, while they are one people,<br/>all speaking the same language,<br/>they have started to do this,<br/>nothing will later stop them from doing whatever they presume to do.<br/>Let us then go down there and confuse their language,<br/>so that one will not understand what another says.”<br/>Thus the LORD scattered them from there all over the earth,<br/>and they stopped building the city.<br/>That is why it was called Babel,<br/>because there the LORD confused the speech of all the world.<br/>It was from that place that he scattered them all over the earth.</p><p><strong>or</strong></p><p>Ex 19:3-8a, 16-20b</p><p>Moses went up the mountain to

(John 6:68c) <strong>Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</strong><br/>The law of the LORD is perfect,<br/>refreshing the soul;<br/>The decree of the LORD is trustworthy,<br/>giving wisdom to the simple.<br/>R. <strong>Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</strong><br/>The precepts of the LORD are right,<br/>rejoicing the heart;<br/>The command of the LORD is clear,<br/>enlightening the eye.<br/>R. <strong>Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</strong><br/>The fear of the LORD is pure,<br/>enduring forever;<br/>The ordinances of the LORD are true,<br/>all of them just.<br/>R. <strong>Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</strong><br/>They are more precious than gold,<br/>than a heap of purest gold;<br/>Sweeter also than syrup<br/>or honey from the comb.<br/>R. <strong>Lord, you have the words of everlasting life.</strong></p><h4>Reading 3EZ 37:1-14</h4><p>The hand of the LORD came upon me,<br/>and he led me out in the spirit of the LORD<br/>and set me in the center of the plain,<br/>which was now filled with bones.<br/>He made me walk among the bones in every direction<br/>so that I saw how many they were on the surface of the plain.<br/>How dry they were!<br/>He asked me:<br/>Son of man, can these bones come to life?<br/>I answered, 'Lord GOD, you alone know that.'<br/>Then he said to me:<br/>Prophesy over these bones, and say to them:<br/>Dry bones, hear the word of the LORD!<br/>Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones:<br/>See! I will bring spirit into you, that you may come to life.<br/>I will put sinews upon you, make flesh grow over you,<br/>cover you with skin, and put spirit in you<br/>so that you may come to life and know that I am the LORD.<br/>I, Ezekiel, prophesied as I had been told,<br/>and even as I was prophesying I heard a noise;<br/>it was a rattling as the bones came together, bone joining bone.<br/>I saw the sinews and the flesh come upon them,<br/>and the skin cover them, but there was no spirit in them.<br/>Then the LORD said to me:<br/>Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man,<br/>and say to the spirit: Thus says the Lord GOD:<br/>From the four winds come, O spirit,<br/>and breathe into these slain that they may come to life.<br/>I prophesied as he told me, and the spirit came into them;<br/>they came alive and stood upright, a vast army.<br/>Then he said to me:<br/>Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.<br/>They have been saying,<br/>'Our bones are dried up,<br/>our hope is lost, and we are cut off.'<br/>Therefore, prophesy and say to them: Thus says the Lord GOD:<br/>O my people, I will open your graves<br/>and have you rise from them,<br/>and bring you back to the land of Israel.<br/>Then you shall know that I am the LORD,<br/>when I open your graves and have you rise from them,<br/>O my people!<br/>I will put my spirit in you that you may live,<br/>and I will settle you upon your land;<br/>thus you shall know that I am the LORD.<br/>I have promised, and I will do it, says the LORD.</p><h4>Responsorial Psalm PSALM 107:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9</h4><p>R.
