He laid his hands on each of them and cured them.<br />And demons also came out from many, shouting, \"You are the Son of God.\" But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.<br />At daybreak, Jesus left and went to a deserted place. The crowds went looking for him, and when they came to him, they tried to prevent him from leaving them.<br />But he said to them, \"To the other towns also I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this purpose I have been sent.\"<br />And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</div></div></div>"

That, when I preach, I offer the gospel free of charge so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.<br />Although I am free in regard to all, I have made myself a slave to all so as to win over as many as possible.<br />To the weak I became weak, to win over the weak. I have become all things to all, to save at least some.<br />All this I do for the sake of the gospel, so that I too may have a share in it.<br />Do you not know that the runners in the stadium all run in the race, but only one wins the prize? Run so as to win.<br />Every athlete exercises discipline in every way. They do it to win a perishable crown, but we an imperishable one.<br />Thus I do not run aimlessly; I do not fight as if I were shadowboxing.<br />No, I drive my body and train it, for fear that, after having preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.</div></div><div><h2>Psalms 84(83),3.4.5-6.12.</h2><div>My soul yearns and pines<br />for the courts of the LORD.<br />My heart and my flesh<br />cry out for the living God.<br /><br />Even the sparrow finds a home,<br />and the swallow a nest<br />in which she puts her young?<br />Your altars, O LORD of hosts,<br />my king and my God!<br /><br />Blessed are they who dwell in your house!<br />Continually they praise you.<br />Happy the men whose strength you are!<br />Their hearts are set upon the pilgrimage.<br /><br />For a sun and shield is the LORD God,<br />bestowing all grace and glory.<br />The LORD withholds no good thing<br />from those who walk without reproach.</div></div><div><h2>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke 6,39-42.</h2><div>Jesus told his disciples a parable : \"Can a blind person guide a blind person?
