He went down to Joppa, found a ship going to Tarshish, paid the fare, and went aboard to journey with them to Tarshish, away from the LORD.<br />The LORD, however, hurled a violent wind upon the sea, and in the furious tempest that arose the ship was on the point of breaking up.<br />Then the mariners became frightened and each one cried to his god. To lighten the ship for themselves, they threw its cargo into the sea. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down into the hold of the ship, and lay there fast asleep.<br />The captain came to him and said, \"What are you doing asleep? Rise up, call upon your God! Perhaps God will be mindful of us so that we may not perish.\"<br />Then they said to one another, \"Come, let us cast lots to find out on whose account we have met with this misfortune.\" So they cast lots, and thus singled out Jonah.<br />\"Tell us,\" they said, \"what is your business?

They stripped and beat him and went off leaving him half-dead.<br />A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.<br />Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.<br />But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.<br />He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them. Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn and cared for him.<br />The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction, 'Take care of him. If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.'<br />Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robbers' victim?\"<br />He answered, \"The one who treated him with mercy.\" Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226) ()</h3><h3> ()</h3>"
