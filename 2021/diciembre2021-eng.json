Thus we know this is the last hour.<br />They went out from us, but they were not really of our number; if they had been, they would have remained with us. Their desertion shows that none of them was of our number.<br />But you have the anointing that comes from the holy one, and you all have knowledge.<br />I write to you not because you do not know the truth but because you do, and because every lie is alien to the truth.</p><h3>Psalms - 96(95),1-2.11-12.13.</h3><p>Sing to the LORD a new song; <br />sing to the LORD, all you lands.<br />Sing to the LORD, bless his name; <br />Announce his salvation day after day.<br />Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; <br />let the sea and what fills it resound;<br />let the plains be joyful and all that is in them. <br />Then shall all the trees of the forest exult before the LORD.<br />The LORD comes, <br />he comes to rule the earth. <br />He shall rule the world with justice <br />and the peoples with his constancy.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 1,1-18.</h3><p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br />He was in the beginning with God.<br />All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be<br />through him was life, and this life was the light of the human race;<br />the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.<br />A man named John was sent from God.<br />He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.<br />He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.<br />The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.<br />He was in the world, and the world came to be through him, but the world did not know him.<br />He came to what was his own, but his own people did not accept him.<br />But to those who did accept him he gave power to become children of God, to those who believe in his name,<br />who were born not by natural generation nor by human choice nor by a man's decision but of God.<br />And the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us, and we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father's only Son, full of grace and truth.<br />John testified to him and cried out, saying, \"This was he of whom I said, 'The one who is coming after me ranks ahead of me because he existed before me.'\"<br />From his fullness we have all received, grace in place of grace,<br />because while the law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.<br />No one has ever seen God. The only Son, God, who is at the Father's side, has revealed him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sylvester I (Pope, (+ 335))</h3><h3> ()</h3>"
