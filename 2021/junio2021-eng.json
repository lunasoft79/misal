My face was uncovered because of the heat.<br />I did not know there were birds perched on the wall above me, till their warm droppings settled in my eyes, causing cataracts. I went to see some doctors for a cure, but the more they anointed my eyes with various salves, the worse the cataracts became, until I could see no more. For four years I was deprived of eyesight, and all my kinsmen were grieved at my condition. Ahiqar, however, took care of me for two years, until he left for Elymais.<br />At that time my wife Anna worked for hire at weaving cloth, the kind of work women do.<br />When she sent back the goods to their owners, they would pay her. Late in winter she finished the cloth and sent it back to the owners. They paid her the full salary, and also gave her a young goat for the table.<br />On entering my house the goat began to bleat. I called to my wife and said: \"Where did this goat come from? Perhaps it was stolen! Give it back to its owners; we have no right to eat stolen food!\"<br />But she said to me, \"It was given to me as a bonus over and above my wages.\" Yet I would not believe her, and told her to give it back to its owners. I became very angry with her over this. So she retorted: \"Where are your charitable deeds now? Where are your virtuous acts? See! Your true character is finally showing itself!\"</p><h3>Psalms - 112(111),1-2.7bc-8.9.</h3><p>Blessed the man who fears the LORD, <br />who greatly delights in his commands.<br />His posterity shall be mighty upon the earth; <br />the upright generation shall be blessed.<br />An evil report he shall not fear;<br />his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.<br />His heart is steadfast; he shall not fear <br />till he looks down upon his foes<br />Lavishly he gives to the poor, <br />his justice shall endure forever; <br />his horn shall be exalted in glory.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark - 12,13-17.</h3><p>Some Pharisees and Herodians were sent to Jesus to ensnare him in his speech.<br />They came and said to him, \"Teacher, we know that you are a truthful man and that you are not concerned with anyone's opinion. You do not regard a person's status but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay the census tax to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?\"<br />Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them, \"Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius to look at.\"<br />They brought one to him and he said to them, \"Whose image and inscription is this?\" They replied to him, \"Caesar's.\"<br />So Jesus said to them, \"Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.\" They were utterly amazed at him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Justin (Martyr (+ c. 165) - Memorial)</h3><h3>St. Pamphilus (Priest & Martyr (+ 308))</h3>"

Then with sobs I began to pray:<br />\"You are righteous, O Lord, and all your deeds are just; All your ways are mercy and truth; you are the judge of the world.<br />And now, O Lord, may you be mindful of me, and look with favor upon me. Punish me not for my sins, nor for my inadvertent offenses, nor for those of my fathers. \"They sinned against you,<br />and disobeyed your commandments. So you handed us over to plundering, exile, and death, till we were an object lesson, a byword, a reproach in all the nations among whom you scattered us.<br />\"Yes, your judgments are many and true in dealing with me as my sins and those of my fathers deserve. For we have not kept your commandments, nor have we trodden the paths of truth before you.<br />\"So now, deal with me as you please, and command my life breath to be taken from me, that I may go from the face of the earth into dust. It is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard insulting calumnies, and I am overwhelmed with grief. \"Lord, command me to be delivered from such anguish; let me go to the everlasting abode; Lord, refuse me not. For it is better for me to die than to endure so much misery in life, and to hear these insults!\"<br />On the same day, at Ecbatana in Media, it so happened that Raguel's daughter Sarah also had to listen to abuse, from one of her father's maids.<br />For she had been married to seven husbands, but the wicked demon Asmodeus killed them off before they could have intercourse with her, as it is prescribed for wives. So the maid said to her: \"You are the one who strangles your husbands! Look at you! You have already been married seven times, but you have had no joy with any one of your husbands.<br />Why do you beat us? Because your husbands are dead? Then why not join them! May we never see a son or daughter of yours!\"<br />That day she was deeply grieved in spirit. She went in tears to an upstairs room in her father's house with the intention of hanging herself. But she reconsidered, saying to herself: \"No! People would level this insult against my father: 'You had only one beloved daughter, but she hanged herself because of ill fortune!' And thus would I cause my father in his old age to go down to the nether world laden with sorrow. It is far better for me not to hang myself, but to beg the Lord to have me die, so that I need no longer live to hear such insults.\"<br />At that time, then, she spread out her hands, and facing the window, poured out this prayer: \"Blessed are you, O Lord, merciful God! Forever blessed and honored is your holy name; may all your works forever bless you.<br />At that very time, the prayer of these two suppliants was heard in the glorious presence of Almighty God.<br />So Raphael was sent to heal them both: to remove the cataracts from Tobit's eyes, so that he might again see God's sunlight; and to marry Raguel's daughter Sarah to Tobit's son Tobiah, and then drive the wicked demon Asmodeus from her.</p><h3>Psalms - 25(24),2-4a.4b-5ab.6-7bc.8-9.</h3><p>In you I trust; let me not be put to shame, <br />let not my enemies exult over me.<br />No one who waits for you shall be put to shame; <br />those shall be put to shame who heedlessly break faith.<br />Your ways, O LORD, make known to me;<br />teach me your paths,<br />guide me in your truth and teach me,<br />for you are God my savior.<br />Remember that your compassion, O LORD, <br />and your love are from of old.<br />In your kindness remember me,<br />because of your goodness, O LORD.<br />Good and upright is the LORD; <br />thus he shows sinners the way.<br />He guides the humble to justice, <br />he teaches the humble his way.  </p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark - 12,18-27.</h3><p>Some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and put this question to him,<br />saying, \"Teacher, Moses wrote for us, 'If someone's brother dies, leaving a wife but no child, his brother must take the wife and raise up descendants for his brother.'<br />Now there were seven brothers. The first married a woman and died, leaving no descendants.<br />So the second married her and died, leaving no descendants, and the third likewise.<br />And the seven left no descendants. Last of all the woman also died.<br />At the resurrection (when they arise) whose wife will she be? For all seven had been married to her.\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"Are you not misled because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?<br />When they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like the angels in heaven.<br />As for the dead being raised, have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God told him, 'I am the God of Abraham, (the) God of Isaac, and (the) God of Jacob'?<br />He is not God of the dead but of the living. You are greatly misled.\"</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Peter & Marcellinus (Martyrs (+ c. 304))</h3><h3>Sts. Pothinus (Sanctus, Attalus, Blandina, & the other Martyrs of Lyons (+ 177))</h3>"

He has a daughter named Sarah.\"<br />When they entered Ecbatana, Tobiah said, \"Brother Azariah, lead me straight to our kinsman Raguel.\" So he brought him to the house of Raguel, whom they found seated by his courtyard gate. They greeted him first. He said to them, \"Greetings to you too, brothers! Good health to you, and welcome!\" When he brought them into his home,<br />Afterward, Raguel slaughtered a ram from the flock and gave them a cordial reception. When they had bathed and reclined to eat, Tobiah said to Raphael, \"Brother Azariah, ask Raguel to let me marry my kinswoman Sarah.\"<br />Raguel overheard the words; so he said to the boy: \"Eat and drink and be merry tonight, for no man is more entitled to marry my daughter Sarah than you, brother. Besides, not even I have the right to give her to anyone but you, because you are my closest relative. But I will explain the situation to you very frankly.<br />I have given her in marriage to seven men, all of whom were kinsmen of ours, and all died on the very night they approached her. But now, son, eat and drink. I am sure the Lord will look after you both.\" Tobiah answered, \"I will eat or drink nothing until you set aside what belongs to me.\" Raguel said to him: \"I will do it. She is yours according to the decree of the Book of Moses. Your marriage to her has been decided in heaven! Take your kinswoman; from now on you are her love, and she is your beloved. She is yours today and ever after. And tonight, son, may the Lord of heaven prosper you both. May he grant you mercy and peace.\"<br />Then Raguel called his daughter Sarah, and she came to him. He took her by the hand and gave her to Tobiah with the words: \"Take her according to the law. According to the decree written in the Book of Moses she is your wife. Take her and bring her back safely to your father. And may the God of heaven grant both of you peace and prosperity.\"<br />He then called her mother and told her to bring a scroll, so that he might draw up a marriage contract stating that he gave Sarah to Tobiah as his wife according to the decree of the Mosaic law. Her mother brought the scroll, and he drew up the contract, to which they affixed their seals.<br />Afterward they began to eat and drink.<br />Later Raguel called his wife Edna and said, \"My love, prepare the other bedroom and bring the girl there.\"<br />She went and made the bed in the room, as she was told, and brought the girl there. After she had cried over her, she wiped away the tears and said:<br />\"Be brave, my daughter. May the Lord of heaven grant you joy in place of your grief. Courage, my daughter.\" Then she left.<br />When the girl's parents left the bedroom and closed the door behind them, Tobiah arose from bed and said to his wife, \"My love, get up. Let us pray and beg our Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us deliverance.\"<br />She got up, and they started to pray and beg that deliverance might be theirs. He began with these words: \"Blessed are you, O God of our fathers; praised be your name forever and ever. Let the heavens and all your creation praise you forever.<br />You made Adam and you gave him his wife Eve to be his help and support; and from these two the human race descended. You said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone; let us make him a partner like himself.'<br />Now, Lord, you know that I take this wife of mine not because of lust, but for a noble purpose. Call down your mercy on me and on her, and allow us to live together to a happy old age.\"<br />They said together, \"Amen, amen,\"<br />and went to bed for the night.</p><h3>Psalms - 128(127),1-2.3.4-5.</h3><p>Blessed are you who fear the LORD, <br />who walk in his ways!<br />For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork; <br />blessed shall you be, and favored.<br />Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine <br />in the recesses of your home; <br />Your children like olive plants <br />around your table.<br />Behold, thus is the man blessed <br />who fears the LORD.<br />The LORD bless you from Zion: <br />may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem <br />all the days of your life.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark - 12,28-34.</h3><p>One of the scribes came to Jesus and asked him, \"Which is the first of all the commandments?\"<br />Jesus replied, \"The first is this: 'Hear, O Israel!

You are right in saying, 'He is One and there is no other than he.'<br />And 'to love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself' is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\"<br />And when Jesus saw that (he) answered with understanding, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p><hr /><h3>St. Charles Lwanga & his companions</h3><h3>St. John XXIII (Pope (1881-1963))</h3>"

Tobiah told his father that his journey had been a success; that he had brought back the money; and that he had married Raguel's daughter Sarah, who would arrive shortly, for she was approaching the gate of Nineveh.

Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.<br />But seek first the kingdom (of God) and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.<br />Do not worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself.

What if only thirty are found there?\" He replied, \"I will forebear doing it if I can find but thirty there.\"<br />Still he went on, \"Since I have thus dared to speak to my Lord, what if there are no more than twenty?\" \"I will not destroy it,\" he answered, \"for the sake of the twenty.\"<br />But he still persisted: \"Please, let not my Lord grow angry if I speak up this last time. What if there are at least ten there?\" \"For the sake of those ten,\" he replied, \"I will not destroy it.\"<br />The LORD departed as soon as he had finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned home.</p><h3>Psalms - 103(102),1-2.3-4.8-9.10-11.</h3><p>Bless the LORD, O my soul; <br />and all my being, bless his holy name.<br />Bless the LORD, O my soul, <br />and forget not all his benefits.<br />He pardons all your iniquities, <br />he heals all your ills.<br />He redeems your life from destruction, <br />he crowns you with kindness and compassion.<br />Merciful and gracious is the LORD, <br />slow to anger and abounding in kindness.<br />He will not always chide, <br />nor does he keep his wrath forever.<br />Not according to our sins does he deal with us, <br />nor does he requite us according to our crimes.<br />For as the heavens are high above the earth, <br />so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew - 8,18-22.</h3><p>When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side.<br />A scribe approached and said to him, \"Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\"<br />Jesus answered him, \"Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest his head.\"<br />Another of (his) disciples said to him, \"Lord, let me go first and bury my father.\"<br />But Jesus answered him, \"Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Irenaeus (Bishop and Martyr (+ 202) - Memorial)</h3><h3></h3>"

(It was (the) feast of Unleavened Bread.)<br />He had him taken into custody and put in prison under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. He intended to bring him before the people after Passover.<br />Peter thus was being kept in prison, but prayer by the church was fervently being made to God on his behalf.<br />On the very night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter, secured by double chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while outside the door guards kept watch on the prison.<br />Suddenly the angel of the Lord stood by him and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on the side and awakened him, saying, \"Get up quickly.\" The chains fell from his wrists.<br />The angel said to him, \"Put on your belt and your sandals.\" He did so. Then he said to him, \"Put on your cloak and follow me.\"<br />So he followed him out, not realizing that what was happening through the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.<br />They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate leading out to the city, which opened for them by itself. They emerged and made their way down an alley, and suddenly the angel left him.<br />Then Peter recovered his senses and said, \"Now I know for certain that (the) Lord sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people had been expecting.\"</p><h3>Psalms - 34(33),2-3.4-5.6-7.8-9.</h3><p>I will bless the LORD at all times; <br />his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br />Let my soul glory in the LORD; <br />the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br />Glorify the LORD with me, <br />let us together extol his name.<br />I sought the LORD, and he answered me <br />and delivered me from all my fears.<br />Look to him that you may be radiant with joy, <br />and your faces may not blush with shame.<br />When the poor one called out, the LORD heard, <br />and from all his distress he saved him.<br />The angel of the LORD encamps <br />around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br />Taste and see how good the LORD is; <br />blessed the man who takes refuge in him.</p><h3>Second Letter to Timothy - 4,6-8.17-18.</h3><p>Beloved: I am already being poured out like a libation, and the time of my departure is at hand.<br />I have competed well; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith.<br />From now on the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but to all who have longed for his appearance.<br />But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the proclamation might be completed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was rescued from the lion's mouth.<br />The Lord will rescue me from every evil threat and will bring me safe to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew - 16,13-19.</h3><p>Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi and he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”<br />They replied, \"Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.\"<br />He said to them, \"But who do you say that I am?\"<br />Simon Peter said in reply, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\"<br />Jesus said to him in reply, \"Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father.<br />And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.<br />I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Judith</h3><h3></h3>"

No son of that slave is going to share the inheritance with my son Isaac!\"<br />Abraham was greatly distressed, especially on account of his son Ishmael.<br />But God said to Abraham: \"Do not be distressed about the boy or about your slave woman. Heed the demands of Sarah, no matter what she is asking of you; for it is through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name.<br />As for the son of the slave woman, I will make a great nation of him also, since he too is your offspring.\"<br />Early the next morning Abraham got some bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. Then, placing the child on her back, he sent her away. As she roamed aimlessly in the wilderness of Beer-sheba,<br />the water in the skin was used up. So she put the child down under a shrub,<br />and then went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away; for she said to herself, \"Let me not watch to see the child die.\" As she sat opposite him, he began to cry.<br />God heard the boy's cry, and God's messenger called to Hagar from heaven: \"What is the matter, Hagar? Don't be afraid; God has heard the boy's cry in this plight of his.<br />Arise, lift up the boy and hold him by the hand; for I will make of him a great nation.\"<br />Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water, and then let the boy drink.<br />God was with the boy as he grew up.</p><h3>Psalms - 34(33),7-8.10-11.12-13.</h3><p>When the poor one called out, the LORD heard, <br />and from all his distress he saved him.<br />The angel of the LORD encamps <br />around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br />Fear the LORD, you his holy ones, <br />for nought is lacking to those who fear him.<br />The great grow poor and hungry; <br />but those who seek the LORD want for no good thing.<br />Come, children, hear me; <br />I will teach you the fear of the LORD.<br />Which of you desires life, <br />and takes delight in prosperous days?</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew - 8,28-34.</h3><p>When Jesus came to the territory of the Gadarenes,<br />two demoniacs who were coming from the tombs met him. They were so savage that no one could travel by that road.<br />They cried out, \"What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the appointed time?\"<br />Some distance away a herd of many swine was feeding.<br />The demons pleaded with him, \"If you drive us out, send us into the herd of swine.\"<br />And he said to them, \"Go then!\" They came out and entered the swine, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea where they drowned.<br />The swineherds ran away, and when they came to the town they reported everything, including what had happened to the demoniacs.<br />Thereupon the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him they begged him to leave their district.</p><hr /><h3>1st Martyrs of Rome (+ 1st century)</h3><h3></h3>"
