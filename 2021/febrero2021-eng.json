I have not time to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,<br />who by faith conquered kingdoms, did what was righteous, obtained the promises; they closed the mouths of lions,<br />put out raging fires, escaped the devouring sword; out of weakness they were made powerful, became strong in battle, and turned back foreign invaders.<br />Women received back their dead through resurrection. Some were tortured and would not accept deliverance, in order to obtain a better resurrection.<br />Others endured mockery, scourging, even chains and imprisonment.<br />They were stoned, sawed in two, put to death at sword's point; they went about in skins of sheep or goats, needy, afflicted, tormented.<br />The world was not worthy of them. They wandered about in deserts and on mountains, in caves and in crevices in the earth.<br />Yet all these, though approved because of their faith, did not receive what had been promised.<br />God had foreseen something better for us, so that without us they should not be made perfect.</p><h3>Psalms - 31(30),20.21.22.23.24.</h3><p>How great is the goodness, O LORD, <br />which you have in store for those who fear you, <br />And which, toward those who take refuge in you, <br />you show in the sight of the children of men.<br />You hide them in the shelter of your presence <br />from the plottings of men; <br />You screen them within your abode <br />from the strife of tongues.<br />Blessed be the LORD whose wondrous mercy <br />he has shown me in a fortified city.<br />Once I said in my anguish, <br />“I am cut off from your sight”; <br />Yet you heard the sound of my pleading <br />when I cried out to you.<br />Love the LORD, all you his faithful ones! <br />The LORD keeps those who are constant, <br />but more than requites those who act proudly.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark - 5,1-20.</h3><p>Jesus and his disciples came to the other side of the sea, to the territory of the Gerasenes.<br />When he got out of the boat, at once a man from the tombs who had an unclean spirit met him.<br />The man had been dwelling among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, even with a chain.<br />In fact, he had frequently been bound with shackles and chains, but the chains had been pulled apart by him and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.<br />Night and day among the tombs and on the hillsides he was always crying out and bruising himself with stones.<br />Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran up and prostrated himself before him,<br />crying out in a loud voice, \"What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me!\"<br />(He had been saying to him, \"Unclean spirit, come out of the man!\")<br />He asked him, \"What is your name?\" He replied, \"Legion is my name. There are many of us.\"<br />And he pleaded earnestly with him not to drive them away from that territory.<br />Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside.<br />And they pleaded with him, \"Send us into the swine. Let us enter them.\"<br />And he let them, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the swine. The herd of about two thousand rushed down a steep bank into the sea, where they were drowned.<br />The swineherds ran away and reported the incident in the town and throughout the countryside. And people came out to see what had happened.<br />As they approached Jesus, they caught sight of the man who had been possessed by Legion, sitting there clothed and in his right mind. And they were seized with fear.<br />Those who witnessed the incident explained to them what had happened to the possessed man and to the swine.<br />Then they began to beg him to leave their district.<br />As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed pleaded to remain with him.<br />But he would not permit him but told him instead, \"Go home to your family and announce to them all that the Lord in his pity has done for you.\"<br />Then the man went off and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him; and all were amazed.</p><h3> - </h3><p></p><hr /><h3>St. Bridgid of Ireland (+ 523) ()</h3><h3> ()</h3>"

This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the holy Spirit was upon him.<br />It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah of the Lord.<br />He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,<br />he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying:<br />Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word,<br />for my eyes have seen your salvation,<br />which you prepared in sight of all the peoples,<br />a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.\"<br />The child's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him;<br />and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, \"Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted<br />(and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\"<br />There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage,<br />and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer.<br />And coming forward at that very time, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.<br />When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions of the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.<br />The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Theophane Venard (Priest & Martyred (1829-1861))</h3><h3>St. Catherine de Ricci (c.1520-1589) ()</h3>"
