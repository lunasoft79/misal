You may take it from either the sheep or the goats.<br />You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and then, with the whole assembly of Israel present, it shall be slaughtered during the evening twilight.<br />They shall take some of its blood and apply it to the two doorposts and the lintel of every house in which they partake of the lamb.<br />That same night they shall eat its roasted flesh with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.<br />\"This is how you are to eat it: with your loins girt, sandals on your feet and your staff in hand, you shall eat like those who are in flight. It is the Passover of the LORD.<br />For on this same night I will go through Egypt, striking down every first--born of the land, both man and beast, and executing judgment on all the gods of Egypt - I, the LORD!<br />But the blood will mark the houses where you are. Seeing the blood, I will pass over you; thus, when I strike the land of Egypt, no destructive blow will come upon you.<br />\"This day shall be a memorial feast for you, which all your generations shall celebrate with pilgrimage to the LORD, as a perpetual institution.\"</p><h3>Psalms - 116(115),12-13.15-16bc.17-18.</h3><p>How shall I make a return to the LORD <br />for all the good he has done for me?<br />The cup of salvation I will take up, <br />and I will call upon the name of the LORD.<br />Precious in the eyes of the LORD <br />is the death of his faithful ones.<br />I am your servant, the son of your handmaid;<br />you have loosed my bonds.<br />To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, <br />and I will call upon the name of the LORD.<br />My vows to the LORD I will pay  <br />in the presence of all his people.  </p><h3>First Letter to the Corinthians - 11,23-26.</h3><p>Brothers and sisters:  I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you,  that the Lord Jesus, on the night he was handed over,  took bread,<br />and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, \"This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.\"<br />In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\"<br />For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 13,1-15.</h3><p>Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come  to pass from this world to the Father.  He loved his own in the world and he loved them to the end.<br />The devil had already induced Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot, to hand him over. So, during supper,<br />fully aware that the Father had put everything into his power and that he had come from God and was returning to God,<br />he rose from supper and took off his outer garments. He took a towel and tied it around his waist.<br />Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel around his waist.<br />He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, \"Master, are you going to wash my feet?\"<br />Jesus answered and said to him, \"What I am doing, you do not understand now, but you will understand later.\"<br />Peter said to him, \"You will never wash my feet.\" Jesus answered him, \"Unless I wash you, you will have no inheritance with me.\"<br />Simon Peter said to him, \"Master, then not only my feet, but my hands and head as well.\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"Whoever has bathed has no need except to have his feet washed, for he is clean all over; so you are clean, but not all.\"<br />For he knew who would betray him; for this reason, he said, \"Not all of you are clean.\"<br />So when he had washed their feet (and) put his garments back on and reclined at table again, he said to them, \"Do you realize what I have done for you?<br />You call me 'teacher' and 'master,' and rightly so, for indeed I am.<br />If I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet.<br />I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hugh (Bishop (1053-1132))</h3><h3>St. Mary of Egypt (Hermit (c.344-421))</h3>"

To whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?<br />He grew up like a sapling before him, like a shoot from the parched earth; There was in him no stately bearing to make us look at him, nor appearance that would attract us to him.<br />He was spurned and avoided by men, a man of suffering, accustomed to infirmity, One of those from whom men hide their faces, spurned, and we held him in no esteem.<br />Yet it was our infirmities that he bore, our sufferings that he endured, While we thought of him as stricken, as one smitten by God and afflicted.<br />But he was pierced for our offenses, crushed for our sins, Upon him was the chastisement that makes us whole, by his stripes we were healed.<br />We had all gone astray like sheep, each following his own way; But the LORD laid upon him the guilt of us all.<br />Though he was harshly treated, he submitted and opened not his mouth; Like a lamb led to the slaughter or a sheep before the shearers, he was silent and opened not his mouth.<br />Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away, and who would have thought any more of his destiny? When he was cut off from the land of the living, and smitten for the sin of his people,<br />A grave was assigned him among the wicked and a burial place with evildoers, Though he had done no wrong nor spoken any falsehood.<br />(But the LORD was pleased to crush him in infirmity.) If he gives his life as an offering for sin, he shall see his descendants in a long life, and the will of the LORD shall be accomplished through him.<br />Because of his affliction he shall see the light in fullness of days; Through his suffering, my servant shall justify many, and their guilt he shall bear.<br />Therefore I will give him his portion among the great, and he shall divide the spoils with the mighty, Because he surrendered himself to death and was counted among the wicked; And he shall take away the sins of many, and win pardon for their offenses.</p><h3>Psalms - 31(30),2.6.12-13.15-16.17.25.</h3><p>In you, O LORD, I take refuge; <br />let me never be put to shame. <br />In your justice rescue me,<br />Into your hands I commend my spirit; <br />You will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God.<br />For all my foes I am an object of reproach, <br />a laughingstock to my neighbors, and a dread to my friends; <br />they who see me abroad flee from me.<br />I am forgotten like the unremembered dead; <br />I am like a dish that is broken.<br />But my trust is in you, O LORD; <br />I say, \"You are my God.<br />In your hands is my destiny; rescue me <br />from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors.\"<br />Let your face shine upon your servant; <br />save me in your kindness.<br />Take courage and be stouthearted,<br />all you who hope in the LORD.</p><h3>Letter to the Hebrews - 4,14-16.5,7-9.</h3><p>Brothers and sisters:  Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,  Jesus, the Son of God,  let us hold fast to our confession.<br />For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has similarly been tested in every way, yet without sin.<br />So let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.<br />In the days when he was in the flesh, he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.<br />Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered;<br />and when he was made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 18,1-40.19,1-42.</h3><p>Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley  to where there was a garden,  into which he and his disciples entered.<br />Judas his betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.<br />So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.<br />Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him, went out and said to them, \"Whom are you looking for?\"<br />They answered him, \"Jesus the Nazorean.\" He said to them, \"I AM.\" Judas his betrayer was also with them.<br />When he said to them, \"I AM,\" they turned away and fell to the ground.<br />So he again asked them, \"Whom are you looking for?\" They said, \"Jesus the Nazorean.\"<br />Jesus answered, \"I told you that I AM. So if you are looking for me, let these men go.\"<br />This was to fulfill what he had said, \"I have not lost any of those you gave me.\"<br />Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. The slave's name was Malchus.<br />Jesus said to Peter, \"Put your sword into its scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?\"<br />So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus, bound him,<br />and brought him to Annas first. He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.<br />It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.<br />Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now the other disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.<br />But Peter stood at the gate outside. So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest, went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.<br />Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter, \"You are not one of this man's disciples, are you?\" He said, \"I am not.\"<br />Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire that they had made, because it was cold, and were warming themselves. Peter was also standing there keeping warm.<br />The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his doctrine.<br />Jesus answered him, \"I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in a synagogue or in the temple area where all the Jews gather, and in secret I have said nothing.<br />Why ask me? Ask those who heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.\"<br />When he had said this, one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said, \"Is this the way you answer the high priest?\"<br />Jesus answered him, \"If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?\"<br />Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.<br />Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm. And they said to him, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it and said, \"I am not.\"<br />One of the slaves of the high priest, a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, \"Didn't I see you in the garden with him?\"<br />Again Peter denied it. And immediately the cock crowed.<br />Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium. It was morning. And they themselves did not enter the praetorium, in order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.<br />So Pilate came out to them and said, \"What charge do you bring (against) this man?\"<br />They answered and said to him, \"If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.\"<br />At this, Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.\" The Jews answered him, \"We do not have the right to execute anyone,\"<br />in order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled that he said indicating the kind of death he would die.<br />So Pilate went back into the praetorium and summoned Jesus and said to him, \"Are you the King of the Jews?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"Do you say this on your own or have others told you about me?\"<br />Pilate answered, \"I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my attendants (would) be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not here.\"<br />So Pilate said to him, \"Then you are a king?\" Jesus answered, \"You say I am a king. For this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.\"<br />Pilate said to him, \"What is truth?\" When he had said this, he again went out to the Jews and said to them, \"I find no guilt in him.<br />But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\"<br />They cried out again, \"Not this one but Barabbas!\" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.<br />Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.<br />And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed him in a purple cloak,<br />and they came to him and said, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\" And they struck him repeatedly.<br />Once more Pilate went out and said to them, \"Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.\"<br />So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, \"Behold, the man!\"<br />When the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out, \"Crucify him, crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no guilt in him.\"<br />The Jews answered, \"We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.\"<br />Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid,<br />and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, \"Where are you from?\" Jesus did not answer him.<br />So Pilate said to him, \"Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you and I have power to crucify you?\"<br />Jesus answered (him), \"You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.\"<br />Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out, \"If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.\"<br />When Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge's bench in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.<br />It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon. And he said to the Jews, \"Behold, your king!\"<br />They cried out, \"Take him away, take him away! Crucify him!\" Pilate said to them, \"Shall I crucify your king?\" The chief priests answered, \"We have no king but Caesar.\"<br />Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus,<br />and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.<br />There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.<br />Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, \"Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.\"<br />Now many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.<br />So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, \"Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that he said, 'I am the King of the Jews.'\"<br />Pilate answered, \"What I have written, I have written.\"<br />When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares, a share for each soldier. They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.<br />So they said to one another, \"Let's not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,\" in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled (that says): \"They divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.\" This is what the soldiers did.<br />Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.<br />When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son.\"<br />Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother.\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br />After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I thirst.\"<br />There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth.<br />When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, \"It is finished.\" And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.<br />Now since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down.<br />So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.<br />But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs,<br />but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.<br />An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he is speaking the truth, so that you also may (come to) believe.<br />For this happened so that the scripture passage might be fulfilled: \"Not a bone of it will be broken.\"<br />And again another passage says: \"They will look upon him whom they have pierced.\"<br />After this, Joseph of Arimathea, secretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. And Pilate permitted it. So he came and took his body.<br />Nicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about one hundred pounds.<br />They took the body of Jesus and bound it with burial cloths along with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.<br />Now in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.<br />So they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day; for the tomb was close by.</p><hr /><h3>St. Francis of Paula (Hermit (1416-1508))</h3><h3></h3>"

Tell the Israelites to go forward.<br />And you, lift up your staff and, with hand outstretched over the sea, split the sea in two, that the Israelites may pass through it on dry land.<br />But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in after them. Then I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and charioteers.<br />The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his chariots and charioteers.\"<br />The angel of God, who had been leading Israel's camp, now moved and went around behind them. The column of cloud also, leaving the front, took up its place behind them,<br />so that it came between the camp of the Egyptians and that of Israel. But the cloud now became dark, and thus the night passed without the rival camps coming any closer together all night long.<br />Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD swept the sea with a strong east wind throughout the night and so turned it into dry land. When the water was thus divided,<br />the Israelites marched into the midst of the sea on dry land, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br />The Egyptians followed in pursuit; all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and charioteers went after them right into the midst of the sea.<br />In the night watch just before dawn the LORD cast through the column of the fiery cloud upon the Egyptian force a glance that threw it into a panic;<br />and he so clogged their chariot wheels that they could hardly drive. With that the Egyptians sounded the retreat before Israel, because the LORD was fighting for them against the Egyptians.<br />Then the LORD told Moses, \"Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the water may flow back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and their charioteers.\"<br />So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea flowed back to its normal depth. The Egyptians were fleeing head on toward the sea, when the LORD hurled them into its midst.<br />As the water flowed back, it covered the chariots and the charioteers of Pharaoh's whole army which had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them escaped.<br />But the Israelites had marched on dry land through the midst of the sea, with the water like a wall to their right and to their left.<br />Thus the LORD saved Israel on that day from the power of the Egyptians. When Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the seashore<br />and beheld the great power that the LORD had shown against the Egyptians, they feared the LORD and believed in him and in his servant Moses.<br />Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD: I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.</p><h3>Book of Exodus - 15,1b-2.3-4.5-6.17-18.</h3><p>I will sing to the LORD, for he is gloriously triumphant; <br />horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.<br />My strength and my courage is the LORD, <br />and he has been my savior. <br />He is my God, I praise him; <br />the God of my father, I extol him.<br />The LORD is a warrior, <br />LORD is his name!<br />Pharaoh's chariots and army he hurled into the sea; <br />the elite of his officers were submerged in the Red Sea.<br />The flood waters covered them, <br />they sank into the depths like a stone.<br />Your right hand, O LORD, magnificent in power, <br />your right hand, O LORD, has shattered the enemy.<br />And you brought them in and planted them <br />on the mountain of your inheritance— <br />the place where you made your seat, O LORD, <br />the sanctuary, O LORD, which your hands established.  <br />The LORD shall reign forever and ever.</p><h3>Letter to the Romans - 6,3-11.</h3><p>Brothers and sisters:  Are you unaware that we who were baptized into Christ Jesus  were baptized into his death?<br />We were indeed buried with him through baptism into death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might live in newness of life.<br />For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection.<br />We know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin.<br />For a dead person has been absolved from sin.<br />If, then, we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.<br />We know that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has power over him.<br />As to his death, he died to sin once and for all; as to his life, he lives for God.<br />Consequently, you too must think of yourselves as (being) dead to sin and living for God in Christ Jesus.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark - 16,1-7.</h3><p>When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go and anoint him.<br />Very early when the sun had risen, on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb.<br />They were saying to one another, \"Who will roll back the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?\"<br />When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back; it was very large.<br />On entering the tomb they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were utterly amazed.<br />He said to them, \"Do not be amazed!

He got up and was baptized,<br />and when he had eaten, he recovered his strength. He stayed some days with the disciples in Damascus,<br />and he began at once to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</p><h3>Psalms - 117(116),1.2.</h3><p>Praise the LORD, all you nations; <br />glorify him, all you peoples!<br />For steadfast is his kindness for us, <br />and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 6,52-59.</h3><p>The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying,  \"How can this man give us his Flesh to eat?\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you.<br />Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day.<br />For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.<br />Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him.<br />Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me.<br />This is the bread that came down from heaven.

Get up and make your bed.\" He got up at once.<br />And all the inhabitants of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.<br />Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which translated means Dorcas). She was completely occupied with good deeds and almsgiving.<br />Now during those days she fell sick and died, so after washing her, they laid (her) out in a room upstairs.<br />Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, \"Please come to us without delay.\"<br />So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs where all the widows came to him weeping and showing him the tunics and cloaks that Dorcas had made while she was with them.<br />Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed. Then he turned to her body and said, \"Tabitha, rise up.\" She opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up.<br />He gave her his hand and raised her up, and when he had called the holy ones and the widows, he presented her alive.<br />This became known all over Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord.</p><h3>Psalms - 116(115),12-13.14-15.16-17.</h3><p>How shall I make a return to the LORD <br />for all the good he has done for me?<br />The cup of salvation I will take up, <br />and I will call upon the name of the LORD.<br />My vows to the LORD I will pay <br />in the presence of all his people.<br />Precious in the eyes of the LORD <br />is the death of his faithful ones.<br />I am your servant; the son of your handmaid; <br />you have loosed my bonds.<br />To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, <br />and I will call upon the name of the LORD.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 6,60-69.</h3><p>Many of the disciples of Jesus who were listening said,  \"This saying is hard; who can accept it?\"<br />Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, \"Does this shock you?<br />What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?<br />It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.<br />But there are some of you who do not believe.\" Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him.<br />And he said, \"For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father.\"<br />As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him.<br />Jesus then said to the Twelve, \"Do you also want to leave?\"<br />Simon Peter answered him, \"Master, to whom shall we go?
