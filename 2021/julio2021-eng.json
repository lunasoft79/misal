He called to him, \"Abraham!\" \"Here I am!\" he replied.<br />Then God said: \"Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There you shall offer him up as a holocaust on a height that I will point out to you.\"<br />Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey, took with him his son Isaac, and two of his servants as well, and with the wood that he had cut for the holocaust, set out for the place of which God had told him.<br />On the third day Abraham got sight of the place from afar.<br />Then he said to his servants: \"Both of you stay here with the donkey, while the boy and I go on over yonder. We will worship and then come back to you.\"<br />Thereupon Abraham took the wood for the holocaust and laid it on his son Isaac's shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife.<br />As the two walked on together, Isaac spoke to his father Abraham. \"Father!\" he said. \"Yes, son,\" he replied. Isaac continued, \"Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the holocaust?\"<br />\"Son,\" Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the sheep for the holocaust.\" Then the two continued going forward.<br />When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. Next he tied up his son Isaac, and put him on top of the wood on the altar.<br />Then he reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.<br />But the LORD'S messenger called to him from heaven, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" \"Yes, Lord,\" he answered.<br />\"Do not lay your hand on the boy,\" said the messenger. \"Do not do the least thing to him. I know now how devoted you are to God, since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son.\"<br />As Abraham looked about, he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket. So he went and took the ram and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.<br />Abraham named the site Yahweh-yireh; hence people now say, \"On the mountain the LORD will see.\"<br />Again the LORD'S messenger called to Abraham from heaven<br />and said: \"I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you acted as you did in not withholding from me your beloved son,<br />I will bless you abundantly and make your descendants as countless as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore; your descendants shall take possession of the gates of their enemies,<br />and in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing--all this because you obeyed my command.'<br />Abraham then returned to his servants, and they set out together for Beer-sheba, where Abraham made his home.</p><h3>Psalms - 115(113B),1-2.3-4.5-6.8-9.</h3><p>Not to us, O LORD, not to us <br />but to your name give glory, <br />because of your mercy, because of your truth.<br />Why should the pagans say, <br />\"Where is their God?\"<br />Our God is in heaven; <br />whatever he wills, he does.<br />Their idols are silver and gold, <br />the handiwork of men.<br />They have mouths but speak not; <br />they have eyes but see not;<br />they have ears but hear not; <br />they have noses but smell not.<br />Their makers shall be like them, <br />everyone that trusts in them.<br />The house of Israel trusts in the LORD, <br />who is their help and shield.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew - 9,1-8.</h3><p>After entering a boat, Jesus made the crossing, and came into his own town.<br />And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Courage, child, your sins are forgiven.\"<br />At that, some of the scribes said to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming.\"<br />Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said, \"Why do you harbor evil thoughts?<br />Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?<br />But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" --he then said to the paralytic, \"Rise, pick up your stretcher, and go home.\"<br />He rose and went home.<br />When the crowds saw this they were struck with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to human beings.</p><hr /><h3>St. Junípero Serra Ferrer (O.F.M.)</h3><h3>Bl.

Please, therefore, forgive the crime that we, the servants of your father's God, committed.\" When they spoke these words to him, Joseph broke into tears.<br />Then his brothers proceeded to fling themselves down before him and said, \"Let us be your slaves!\"<br />But Joseph replied to them: \"Have no fear. Can I take the place of God?<br />Even though you meant harm to me, God meant it for good, to achieve his present end, the survival of many people.<br />Therefore have no fear. I will provide for you and for your children.\" By thus speaking kindly to them, he reassured them.<br />Joseph remained in Egypt, together with his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years.<br />He saw Ephraim's children to the third generation, and the children of Manasseh's son Machir were also born on Joseph's knees.<br />Joseph said to his brothers: \"I am about to die.

Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us.<br />This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us, that he has given us of his Spirit.<br />Moreover, we have seen and testify that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.<br />Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God.<br />We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us. God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him.</p><h3>Psalms - 34(33),2-3.4-5.6-7.8-9.10-11.</h3><p>I will bless the LORD at all times; <br />his praise shall be ever in my mouth.<br />Let my soul glory in the LORD; <br />the lowly will hear me and be glad.<br />Glorify the LORD with me, <br />let us together extol his name.<br />I sought the LORD, and he answered me <br />and delivered me from all my fears.<br />Look to him that you may be radiant with joy, <br />and your faces may not blush with shame.<br />When the poor one called out, the LORD heard, <br />and from all his distress he saved him.<br />The angel of the LORD encamps <br />around those who fear him, and delivers them.<br />Taste and see how good the LORD is; <br />blessed the man who takes refuge in him.<br />Fear the LORD, you his holy ones, <br />for nought is lacking to those who fear him.<br />The great grow poor and hungry; <br />but those who seek the LORD want for no good thing.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 11,19-27.</h3><p>Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother [Lazarus, who had died].<br />When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat at home.<br />Martha said to Jesus, \"Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.<br />But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.\"<br />Jesus said to her, \"Your brother will rise.\"<br />Martha said to him, \"I know he will rise, in the resurrection on the last day.\"<br />Jesus told her, \"I am the resurrection and the life; whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live,<br />and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?\"<br />She said to him, \"Yes, Lord. I have come to believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who is coming into the world.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Martha - Memorial</h3><h3>St. Peter & Marcellinus</h3>"

For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.<br />On the first of these days you shall hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work.<br />On each of the seven days you shall offer an oblation to the LORD. Then on the seventh day you shall again hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work.\"<br />The LORD said to Moses,<br />\"Speak to the Israelites and tell them: When you come into the land which I am giving you, and reap your harvest, you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest,<br />who shall wave the sheaf before the LORD that it may be acceptable for you.

Is not his mother named Mary and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?<br />Are not his sisters all with us? Where did this man get all this?\"<br />And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, \"A prophet is not without honor except in his native place and in his own house.\"<br />And he did not work many mighty deeds there because of their lack of faith.</p><hr /><h3>St. Peter Chrysologus (Bishop and Doctor of the Church (406-450))</h3><h3>St. Germanus (Bishop († 448))</h3>"
