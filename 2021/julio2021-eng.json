He called to him, \"Abraham!\" \"Here I am!\" he replied.<br />Then God said: \"Take your son Isaac, your only one, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. There you shall offer him up as a holocaust on a height that I will point out to you.\"<br />Early the next morning Abraham saddled his donkey, took with him his son Isaac, and two of his servants as well, and with the wood that he had cut for the holocaust, set out for the place of which God had told him.<br />On the third day Abraham got sight of the place from afar.<br />Then he said to his servants: \"Both of you stay here with the donkey, while the boy and I go on over yonder. We will worship and then come back to you.\"<br />Thereupon Abraham took the wood for the holocaust and laid it on his son Isaac's shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife.<br />As the two walked on together, Isaac spoke to his father Abraham. \"Father!\" he said. \"Yes, son,\" he replied. Isaac continued, \"Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the sheep for the holocaust?\"<br />\"Son,\" Abraham answered, \"God himself will provide the sheep for the holocaust.\" Then the two continued going forward.<br />When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. Next he tied up his son Isaac, and put him on top of the wood on the altar.<br />Then he reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.<br />But the LORD'S messenger called to him from heaven, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" \"Yes, Lord,\" he answered.<br />\"Do not lay your hand on the boy,\" said the messenger. \"Do not do the least thing to him. I know now how devoted you are to God, since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son.\"<br />As Abraham looked about, he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket. So he went and took the ram and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.<br />Abraham named the site Yahweh-yireh; hence people now say, \"On the mountain the LORD will see.\"<br />Again the LORD'S messenger called to Abraham from heaven<br />and said: \"I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you acted as you did in not withholding from me your beloved son,<br />I will bless you abundantly and make your descendants as countless as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore; your descendants shall take possession of the gates of their enemies,<br />and in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing--all this because you obeyed my command.'<br />Abraham then returned to his servants, and they set out together for Beer-sheba, where Abraham made his home.</p><h3>Psalms - 115(113B),1-2.3-4.5-6.8-9.</h3><p>Not to us, O LORD, not to us <br />but to your name give glory, <br />because of your mercy, because of your truth.<br />Why should the pagans say, <br />\"Where is their God?\"<br />Our God is in heaven; <br />whatever he wills, he does.<br />Their idols are silver and gold, <br />the handiwork of men.<br />They have mouths but speak not; <br />they have eyes but see not;<br />they have ears but hear not; <br />they have noses but smell not.<br />Their makers shall be like them, <br />everyone that trusts in them.<br />The house of Israel trusts in the LORD, <br />who is their help and shield.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew - 9,1-8.</h3><p>After entering a boat, Jesus made the crossing, and came into his own town.<br />And there people brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \"Courage, child, your sins are forgiven.\"<br />At that, some of the scribes said to themselves, \"This man is blaspheming.\"<br />Jesus knew what they were thinking, and said, \"Why do you harbor evil thoughts?<br />Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?<br />But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins\" --he then said to the paralytic, \"Rise, pick up your stretcher, and go home.\"<br />He rose and went home.<br />When the crowds saw this they were struck with awe and glorified God who had given such authority to human beings.</p><hr /><h3>St. Jun√≠pero Serra Ferrer (O.F.M.)</h3><h3>Bl.

He said to him, \"Follow me.\" And he got up and followed him.<br />While he was at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Jesus and his disciples.<br />The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, \"Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?\"<br />He heard this and said, \"Those who are well do not need a physician, but the sick do.<br />Go and learn the meaning of the words, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.'

Please, therefore, forgive the crime that we, the servants of your father's God, committed.\" When they spoke these words to him, Joseph broke into tears.<br />Then his brothers proceeded to fling themselves down before him and said, \"Let us be your slaves!\"<br />But Joseph replied to them: \"Have no fear. Can I take the place of God?<br />Even though you meant harm to me, God meant it for good, to achieve his present end, the survival of many people.<br />Therefore have no fear. I will provide for you and for your children.\" By thus speaking kindly to them, he reassured them.<br />Joseph remained in Egypt, together with his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years.<br />He saw Ephraim's children to the third generation, and the children of Manasseh's son Machir were also born on Joseph's knees.<br />Joseph said to his brothers: \"I am about to die.

Moses then spoke to them.<br />Later on, all the Israelites came up to him, and he enjoined on them all that the LORD had told him on Mount Sinai.<br />When he finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.<br />Whenever Moses entered the presence of the LORD to converse with him, he removed the veil until he came out again. On coming out, he would tell the Israelites all that had been commanded.<br />Then the Israelites would see that the skin of Moses' face was radiant; so he would again put the veil over his face until he went in to converse with the LORD.</p><h3>Psalms - 99(98),5.6.7.9.</h3><p>Extol the LORD, our God, <br />and worship at his footstool; <br />holy is he!<br />Moses and Aaron were among his priests, <br />and Samuel, among those who called upon his name; <br />they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.<br />From the pillar of cloud he spoke to them; <br />they heard his decrees and the law he gave them.<br />Extol the LORD, our God, <br />and worship at his holy mountain; <br />for holy is the LORD, our God.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew - 13,44-46.</h3><p>Jesus said to his disciples: ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a field, which a person finds and hides again, and out of joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.<br />Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.<br />When he finds a pearl of great price, he goes and sells all that he has and buys it\".</p><hr /><h3>St. Pedro Poveda Castroverde (Priest & Martyr (1874-1936))</h3><h3>St. Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception (1910-1946)</h3>"

Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us.<br />This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us, that he has given us of his Spirit.<br />Moreover, we have seen and testify that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world.<br />Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God.<br />We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us.
