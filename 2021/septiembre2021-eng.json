Of this you have already heard through the word of truth, the gospel,<br />that has come to you. Just as in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing, so also among you, from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth,<br />as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow slave, who is a trustworthy minister of Christ on your behalf<br />and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.</p><h3>Psalms - 52(51),10.11.</h3><p>I, like a green olive tree <br />in the house of God, <br />Trust in the mercy of God <br />forever and ever.<br />I will thank you always for what you have done, <br />and proclaim the goodness of your name <br />before your faithful ones.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke - 4,38-44.</h3><p>After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon. Simon's mother-in-law was afflicted with a severe fever, and they interceded with him about her.<br />He stood over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately and waited on them.<br />At sunset, all who had people sick with various diseases brought them to him. He laid his hands on each of them and cured them.<br />And demons also came out from many, shouting, \"You are the Son of God.\" But he rebuked them and did not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Messiah.<br />At daybreak, Jesus left and went to a deserted place. The crowds went looking for him, and when they came to him, they tried to prevent him from leaving them.<br />But he said to them, \"To the other towns also I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this purpose I have been sent.\"<br />And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</p><hr /><h3>St. Giles of Castaneda (Abbot (640-720))</h3><h3></h3>"

Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.<br />After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \"Put out into deep water and lower your nets for a catch.\"<br />Simon said in reply, \"Master, we have worked hard all night and have caught nothing, but at your command I will lower the nets.\"<br />When they had done this, they caught a great number of fish and their nets were tearing.<br />They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come to help them. They came and filled both boats so that they were in danger of sinking.<br />When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at the knees of Jesus and said, \"Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.\"<br />For astonishment at the catch of fish they had made seized him and all those with him,<br />and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners of Simon. Jesus said to Simon, \"Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.\"<br />When they brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed him.</p><hr /><h3>Bl.
