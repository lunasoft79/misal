I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.<br />Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?'<br />Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.<br />So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\"</p><h3> - </h3><p></p><hr /><h3>St. Frances of Rome (religious (1384-1440))</h3><h3></h3>"

Then I will make of you a great nation.\"<br />But Moses implored the LORD, his God, saying, \"Why, O LORD, should your wrath blaze up against your own people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with such great power and with so strong a hand?<br />Why should the Egyptians say, 'With evil intent he brought them out, that he might kill them in the mountains and exterminate them from the face of the earth'? Let your blazing wrath die down; relent in punishing your people.<br />Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and how you swore to them by your own self, saying, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky; and all this land that I promised, I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.'\"<br />So the LORD relented in the punishment he had threatened to inflict on his people.</p><h3>Psalms - 106(105),19-20.21-22.23.</h3><p>Our fathers made a calf in Horeb <br />and adored a molten image;<br />They exchanged their glory <br />for the image of a grass-eating bullock.<br />They forgot the God who had saved them, <br />who had done great deeds in Egypt,<br />Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, <br />terrible things at the Red Sea.<br />Then he spoke of exterminating them, <br />but Moses, his chosen one, <br />withstood him in the breach <br />to turn back his destructive wrath.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 5,31-47.</h3><p>Jesus said to the Jews: \"If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is not true.<br />But there is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is true.<br />You sent emissaries to John, and he testified to the truth.<br />I do not accept testimony from a human being, but I say this so that you may be saved.<br />He was a burning and shining lamp, and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light.<br />But I have testimony greater than John's.

She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.<br />Nobody else was there except the two elders, who had hidden themselves and were watching her.<br />\"Bring me oil and soap,\" she said to the maids, \"and shut the garden doors while I bathe.\"<br />As soon as the maids had left, the two old men got up and hurried to her.<br />\"Look,\" they said, \"the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us; give in to our desire, and lie with us.<br />If you refuse, we will testify against you that you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.\"<br />\"I am completely trapped,\" Susanna groaned. \"If I yield, it will be my death; if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.<br />Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guilt than to sin before the Lord.\"<br />Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,<br />as one of them ran to open the garden doors.<br />When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden, they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.<br />At the accusations by the old men, the servants felt very much ashamed, for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.<br />When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day, the two wicked elders also came, fully determined to put Susanna to death. Before all the people they ordered:<br />\"Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, the wife of Joakim.\" When she was sent for,<br />she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.<br />All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.<br />In the midst of the people the two elders rose up and laid their hands on her head.<br />Through her tears she looked up to heaven, for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.<br />The elders made this accusation: \"As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman entered with two girls and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.<br />A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.<br />When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime, we ran toward them.<br />We saw them lying together, but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we; he opened the doors and ran off.<br />Then we seized this one and asked who the young man was,<br />but she refused to tell us. We testify to this.\" The assembly believed them, since they were elders and judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.<br />But Susanna cried aloud: \"O eternal God, you know what is hidden and are aware of all things before they come to be:<br />you know that they have testified falsely against me. Here I am about to die, though I have done none of the things with which these wicked men have charged me.\"<br />The Lord heard her prayer.<br />As she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,<br />and he cried aloud: \"I will have no part in the death of this woman.\"<br />All the people turned and asked him, \"What is this you are saying?\"<br />He stood in their midst and continued, \"Are you such fools, O Israelites! To condemn a woman of Israel without examination and without clear evidence?<br />Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.\"<br />Then all the people returned in haste. To Daniel the elders said, \"Come, sit with us and inform us, since God has given you the prestige of old age.\"<br />But he replied, \"Separate these two far from one another that I may examine them.\"<br />After they were separated one from the other, he called one of them and said: \"How you have grown evil with age! Now have your past sins come to term:<br />passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent, and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says, \"The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'<br />Now, then, if you were a witness, tell me under what tree you saw them together.\"<br />\"Under a mastic tree,\" he answered. \"Your fine lie has cost you your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him and split you in two.\"<br />Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought. \"Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,\" Daniel said to him, \"beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience.<br />This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel, and in their fear they yielded to you; but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.<br />Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.\"<br />\"Under an oak,\" he said. \"Your fine lie has cost you also your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two so as to make an end of you both.\"<br />The whole assembly cried aloud, blessing God who saves those that hope in him.<br />They rose up against the two elders, for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury. According to the law of Moses, they inflicted on them the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:<br />they put them to death. Thus was innocent blood spared that day.</p><h3>Psalms - 23(22),1-3a.3b-4.5.6.</h3><p>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br />In verdant pastures he gives me repose; <br />beside restful waters he leads me;<br />he refreshes my soul. <br />He guides me in right paths<br />for His names's sake.<br />Even though I walk in the dark valley <br />I fear no evil; for you are at my side <br />with your rod and your staff <br />that give me courage.<br />You spread the table before me <br />in the sight of my foes; <br />You anoint my head with oil; <br />my cup overflows.<br />Only goodness and kindness follow me <br />all the days of my life; <br />and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD <br />for years to come.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John - 8,1-11.</h3><p>Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<br />But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area, and all the people started coming to him, and he sat down and taught them.<br />Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle.<br />They said to him, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.<br />Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?\"<br />They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.<br />But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, \"Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\"<br />Again he bent down and wrote on the ground.<br />And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him.<br />Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"<br />She replied, \"No one, sir.\" Then Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you. Go, (and) from now on do not sin any more.\"</p><h3> - </h3><p></p><hr /><h3>Bl.

So the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to arrest him by treachery and put him to death.<br />They said, \"Not during the festival, for fear that there may be a riot among the people.\"<br />When he was in Bethany reclining at table in the house of Simon the leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of perfumed oil, costly genuine spikenard. She broke the alabaster jar and poured it on his head.<br />There were some who were indignant. \"Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil?<br />It could have been sold for more than three hundred days' wages and the money given to the poor.\" They were infuriated with her.<br />Jesus said, \"Let her alone. Why do you make trouble for her? She has done a good thing for me.<br />The poor you will always have with you, and whenever you wish you can do good to them, but you will not always have me.<br />She has done what she could. She has anticipated anointing my body for burial.<br />Amen, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed to the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.\"<br />Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went off to the chief priests to hand him over to them.<br />When they heard him they were pleased and promised to pay him money. Then he looked for an opportunity to hand him over.<br />On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, \"Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?\"<br />He sent two of his disciples and said to them, \"Go into the city and a man will meet you, carrying a jar of water. Follow him.<br />Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, \"Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?\"'<br />Then he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.\"<br />The disciples then went off, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them; and they prepared the Passover.<br />When it was evening, he came with the Twelve.<br />And as they reclined at table and were eating, Jesus said, \"Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.\"<br />They began to be distressed and to say to him, one by one, \"Surely it is not I?\"<br />He said to them, \"One of the Twelve, the one who dips with me into the dish.<br />For the Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for that man if he had never been born.\"<br />While they were eating, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, and said, \"Take it; this is my body.\"<br />Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.<br />He said to them, \"This is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed for many.<br />Amen, I say to you, I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\"<br />Then, after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.<br />Then Jesus said to them, \"All of you will have your faith shaken, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be dispersed.'<br />But after I have been raised up, I shall go before you to Galilee.\"<br />Peter said to him, \"Even though all should have their faith shaken, mine will not be.\"<br />Then Jesus said to him, \"Amen, I say to you, this very night before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times.\"<br />But he vehemently replied, \"Even though I should have to die with you, I will not deny you.\" And they all spoke similarly.<br />Then they came to a place named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, \"Sit here while I pray.\"<br />He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be troubled and distressed.<br />Then he said to them, \"My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch.\"<br />He advanced a little and fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass by him;<br />he said, \"Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take this cup away from me, but not what I will but what you will.\"<br />When he returned he found them asleep. He said to Peter, \"Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?<br />Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\"<br />Withdrawing again, he prayed, saying the same thing.<br />Then he returned once more and found them asleep, for they could not keep their eyes open and did not know what to answer him.<br />He returned a third time and said to them, \"Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners.<br />Get up, let us go. See, my betrayer is at hand.\"<br />Then, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs who had come from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.<br />His betrayer had arranged a signal with them, saying, \"The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him and lead him away securely.\"<br />He came and immediately went over to him and said, \"Rabbi.\" And he kissed him.<br />At this they laid hands on him and arrested him.<br />One of the bystanders drew his sword, struck the high priest's servant, and cut off his ear.<br />Jesus said to them in reply, \"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs, to seize me?<br />Day after day I was with you teaching in the temple area, yet you did not arrest me; but that the scriptures may be fulfilled.\"<br />And they all left him and fled.<br />Now a young man followed him wearing nothing but a linen cloth about his body. They seized him,<br />but he left the cloth behind and ran off naked.<br />They led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.<br />Peter followed him at a distance into the high priest's courtyard and was seated with the guards, warming himself at the fire.<br />The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin kept trying to obtain testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they found none.<br />Many gave false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.<br />Some took the stand and testified falsely against him, alleging,<br />We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple made with hands and within three days I will build another not made with hands.'<br />Even so their testimony did not agree.<br />The high priest rose before the assembly and questioned Jesus, saying, \"Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?\"<br />But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, \"Are you the Messiah, the son of the Blessed One?\"<br />Then Jesus answered, \"I am; and 'you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.'\"<br />At that the high priest tore his garments and said, \"What further need have we of witnesses?<br />You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?\" They all condemned him as deserving to die.<br />Some began to spit on him. They blindfolded him and struck him and said to him, \"Prophesy!\" And the guards greeted him with blows.<br />While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest's maids came along.<br />Seeing Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, \"You too were with the Nazarene, Jesus.\"<br />But he denied it saying, \"I neither know nor understand what you are talking about.\" So he went out into the outer court. (Then the cock crowed.)<br />The maid saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, \"This man is one of them.\"<br />Once again he denied it. A little later the bystanders said to Peter once more, \"Surely you are one of them; for you too are a Galilean.\"<br />He began to curse and to swear, \"I do not know this man about whom you are talking.\"<br />And immediately a cock crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, \"Before the cock crows twice you will deny me three times.\" He broke down and wept.<br />As soon as morning came, the chief priests with the elders and the scribes, that is, the whole Sanhedrin, held a council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.<br />Pilate questioned him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\" He said to him in reply, \"You say so.\"<br />The chief priests accused him of many things.<br />Again Pilate questioned him, \"Have you no answer? See how many things they accuse you of.\"<br />Jesus gave him no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed.<br />Now on the occasion of the feast he used to release to them one prisoner whom they requested.<br />A man called Barabbas was then in prison along with the rebels who had committed murder in a rebellion.<br />The crowd came forward and began to ask him to do for them as he was accustomed.<br />Pilate answered, \"Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?\"<br />For he knew that it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed him over.<br />But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.<br />Pilate again said to them in reply, \"Then what (do you want) me to do with (the man you call) the king of the Jews?\"<br />They shouted again, \"Crucify him.\"<br />Pilate said to them, \"Why? What evil has he done?\" They only shouted the louder, \"Crucify him.\"<br />So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them and, after he had Jesus scourged, handed him over to be crucified.<br />The soldiers led him away inside the palace, that is, the praetorium, and assembled the whole cohort.<br />They clothed him in purple and, weaving a crown of thorns, placed it on him.<br />They began to salute him with, \"Hail, King of the Jews!\"<br />and kept striking his head with a reed and spitting upon him. They knelt before him in homage.<br />And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him out to crucify him.<br />They pressed into service a passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.<br />They brought him to the place of Golgotha (which is translated Place of the Skull).<br />They gave him wine drugged with myrrh, but he did not take it.<br />Then they crucified him and divided his garments by casting lots for them to see what each should take.<br />It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.<br />The inscription of the charge against him read, \"The King of the Jews.\"<br />With him they crucified two revolutionaries, one on his right and one on his left.<br />)<br />Those passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, \"Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,<br />save yourself by coming down from the cross.\"<br />Likewise the chief priests, with the scribes, mocked him among themselves and said, \"He saved others; he cannot save himself.<br />Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.\" Those who were crucified with him also kept abusing him.<br />At noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.<br />And at three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, \"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\" which is translated, \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"<br />Some of the bystanders who heard it said, \"Look, he is calling Elijah.\"<br />One of them ran, soaked a sponge with wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, \"Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down.\"<br />Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.<br />The veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.<br />When the centurion who stood facing him saw how he breathed his last he said, \"Truly this man was the Son of God!\"<br />There were also women looking on from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome.<br />These women had followed him when he was in Galilee and ministered to him. There were also many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem.<br />When it was already evening, since it was the day of preparation, the day before the sabbath,<br />Joseph of Arimathea, a distinguished member of the council, who was himself awaiting the kingdom of God, came and courageously went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<br />Pilate was amazed that he was already dead. He summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died.<br />And when he learned of it from the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.<br />Having bought a linen cloth, he took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb that had been hewn out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb.<br />Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses watched where he was laid.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gontran (King (545-592))</h3><h3></h3>"

And it was night.<br />When Judas had left them, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.<br />(If God is glorified in him,) God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him at once.<br />My children, I will be with you only a little while longer. You will look for me, and as I told the Jews, 'Where I go you cannot come,' so now I say it to you.<br />Simon Peter said to him, \"Master, where are you going?\" Jesus answered (him), \"Where I am going, you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later.\"<br />Peter said to him, \"Master, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.\"<br />Jesus answered, \"Will you lay down your life for me? Amen, amen, I say to you, the cock will not crow before you deny me three times.\"</p><h3> - </h3><p></p><hr /><h3>St. John Climacus (anchorite (6th-7th centuries))</h3><h3></h3>"
